## 英文原版

Beautiful is better than ugly.

Explicit is better than implicit.

Simple is better than complex.

Complex is better than complicated.

Flat is better than nested.

Sparse is better than dense.

Readability counts.

Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.

Although practicality beats purity.

Errors should never pass silently.

Unless explicitly silenced.

In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.

There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.

Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.

Now is better than never.

Although never is often better than **right** now.

If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.

If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.

Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

## 中文翻译

美丽胜于丑陋。

明示胜于暗示。

简单胜于复杂。

复杂优于凌乱。

扁平优于嵌套。

稀疏比密集好。

可读性很重要。

即便假借特例的实用性之名，也不可违背这些规则。

不要包容所有错误，除非你确定需要这样做

面对模棱两可的情况，要拒绝猜测的诱惑。

应该有一种--最好只有一种--显而易见的方法。

虽然这并不容易，因为你不是 Python 之父

现在做总比永远不做强，但不假思索就动手还不如不做

如果实施起来很难解释，那就是个坏主意。

如果实现起来很容易解释，那可能是个好主意。

命名空间就是一个伟大的想法--让我们多做这样的事情吧！
