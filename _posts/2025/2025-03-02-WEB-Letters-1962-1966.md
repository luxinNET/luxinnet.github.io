1962年7月6日

_A Reminder:_

_提醒：_

In my letter of January 24, 1962 reporting on 1961, I inserted a section entitled. "And a Prediction." While I have no desire to inflict cruel and unusual punishment upon my readers, nevertheless, a reprinting of that section, in its entirety, may be worthwhile: 

在我 1962年1月24日汇报1961年情况的信件中，插入了一个名为 “一个预测” 的章节。虽然我不想给读者带来残酷和不寻常的 “惩罚”，但全文重印该章节或许是有价值的：

    _And a Prediction_

    _一个预测_

    Regular readers (I may be flattering myself) will feel I have left the tracks when I start talking about predictions. This is one thing from which I have always shied away and I still do in the normal sense. 

    老读者（或许是我自夸了）可能会觉得，当我开始谈论预测时，就偏离了正轨。这是我一直回避的事情，通常情况下现在也依然如此。

    I am certainly not going to predict what general business or the stock market are going to do in the next year or two since I don't have the faintest idea.

    我当然不会预测未来一两年内整体商业形势或股市的走势，因为我完全没有头绪。

    I think you can be quite sure that over the next ten years there are going to be a few years when the  general market is plus 20% or 25%, a few when it is minus on the same order, and a majority when it is in between. I haven't any notion as to the sequence in which these will occur, nor do I think it is of any great importance for the long-term investor.

    我认为你可以十分确定，在未来十年里，会有几年股市大盘上涨 20% 或 25%，也会有几年下跌相同幅度，而大多数年份涨跌幅度介于两者之间。我不清楚这些情况出现的先后顺序，而且我认为这对长期投资者来说也并非至关重要。

    Over any long period of years, I think it likely that the Dow will probably produce something like 5% to 7% per year compounded from a combination of dividends and market value gain. Despite the experience of recent years, anyone expecting substantially better than that from the general market probably faces disappointment.

    在任何较长的时间段内，我认为道琼斯指数很可能会通过股息和市值增长的综合作用，实现每年约 5% 至 7% 的复合增长率。尽管近年来市场表现有所不同，但任何期望股市大盘表现大幅优于这一水平的人，可能都会失望。

    Our job is to pile up yearly advantages over the performance of the Dow without worrying too much about whether the absolute results in a given year are a plus or a minus. I would consider a year in which we were down 15% and the Dow declined 25% to be much superior to a year when both the partnership and the Dow advanced 20%. I have stressed this point in talking with partners and have watched them nod their heads with varying degrees of enthusiasm.

    我们的工作是每年都要在业绩上超越道琼斯指数，而不必过于担心某一年的绝对业绩是正还是负。我会认为，在我们下跌 15% 而道琼斯指数下跌 25% 的年份，要比我们和道琼斯指数都上涨 20% 的年份好得多。我在与合伙人交谈时强调过这一点，看到他们不同程度地点头表示认同。

    It is most important to me that you fully understand my reasoning in this regard and agree with me not only in your cerebral regions, but also down in the pit of your stomach.

    对我来说，最重要的是你能完全理解我在这方面的推理，不仅在理智上认同，更要从心底里认同。

    For the reasons outlined in my method of operation, our best years relative to the Dow are likely to be in declining or static markets. Therefore, the advantage we seek will probably come in sharply varying amounts. There are bound to be years when we are surpassed by the Dow, but if over a long period we can average ten percentage points per year better than it, I will feel the results have been satisfactory.

    基于我运营方法中概述的原因，相对于道琼斯指数，我们表现最佳的年份很可能出现在市场下跌或平稳时期。因此，我们所追求的优势幅度可能会有很大差异。必然会有一些年份，我们的表现不如道琼斯指数，但如果从长期来看，我们每年平均能比它高出 10 个百分点，我就会认为结果是令人满意的。

    Specifically, if the market should be down 35% or 40% in a year (and I feel this has a high probability of occurring one year in the next ten--no one knows which one), we should be down only 15% or 20%. If it is more or less unchanged during the year, we would hope to be up about ten percentage points. If it is up 20% or more, we would struggle to be up as much. The consequence of performance such as this over a period of years would mean that if the Dow produces a 5% to 7% per year over-all gain compounded, I would hope our results might be 15% to 17% per year.

    具体来说，如果某一年市场下跌 35% 或 40%（我觉得在未来十年里，很有可能会有这样一年 —— 没人知道是哪一年），我们的跌幅应该只有 15% 或 20%。如果当年市场基本持平，我们希望能上涨约 10 个百分点。如果市场上涨 20% 或更多，我们会努力跟上涨幅。如果多年来都保持这样的表现，那就意味着，如果道琼斯指数每年实现 5% 至 7% 的复合总涨幅，我希望我们的业绩能达到每年 15% 至 17%。

    The above expectations may sound somewhat rash, and there is no question but that they may appear very much so when viewed from the vantage point of 1965 or 1970. It may turn out that I am completely wrong. However, I feel the partners are certainly entitled to know what I am thinking in this regard even though the nature of the business is such as to introduce a high probability of error in such expectations. In anyone year, the variations may be quite substantial. This happened in 1961, but fortunately the variation was on the pleasant side. They won't all be!

    上述预期听起来可能有些草率，从 1965 年或 1970 年的角度来看，这些预期无疑会显得非常草率。结果也可能证明我完全错了。然而，我觉得合伙人当然有权知道我在这方面的想法，尽管这项业务的性质决定了这类预期很可能存在误差。在任何一年里，实际表现的差异可能都相当大。1961 年就是如此，幸运的是，那次差异是积极的。但不可能每次都这么幸运！

_The First Half of 1962:_

_1962 年上半年_

Between yearend 1961 and June 30, 1962 the Dow declined from 731.14 to 561.28. If one had owned the Dow 
during this period, dividends of approximately $11.00 would have been received so that overall a loss of 21.7% would have been the result of investing in the Dow. For the statistical minded, Appendix A gives the results of the Dow by years since formation of the predecessor partnerships.

1961 年底至 1962 年 6 月 30 日期间，道琼斯指数从 731.14 点跌至 561.28 点。如果在此期间持有道琼斯指数成分股，大约会获得 11.00 美元的股息，因此投资道琼斯指数的总体损失为 21.7%。对于喜欢统计数据的人，附录 A 列出了自前期合伙公司成立以来道琼斯指数各年度的表现。

As stated above, a declining Dow gives us our chance to shine and pile up the percentage advantages which, coupled with only an average performance during advancing markets, will give us quite satisfactory long-term results. Our target is an approximately 1/2% decline for each 1% decline in the Dow and if achieved, means we have a considerably more conservative vehicle for investment in stocks than practically any alternative.

如前所述，道琼斯指数下跌为我们提供了展现优势的机会，让我们能积累百分比优势。在上涨市场中我们只要保持平均表现，长期来看就能取得相当令人满意的结果。我们的目标是道琼斯指数每下跌 1%，我们的跌幅约为 0.5%。如果能实现这一目标，那就意味着我们的股票投资工具比几乎任何其他选择都更加保守。

As outlined in Appendix B, showing combined predecessor partnership results, during the first half of 1962 we had one of the best periods in our history, achieving a minus 7.5% result before payments to partners, compared to the minus 21.7% overall result on the Dow. This 14.2 percentage points advantage can be expected to widen during the second half if the decline in the general market continues, but will probably narrow should the market turn upward. Please keep in mind my continuing admonition that six-months' or even one-year's results are not to be taken too seriously. Short periods of measurement exaggerate chance fluctuations in performance. While circumstances contributed to an unusually good first half, there are bound to be periods when we do relatively poorly. The figures for our performance involve no change in the valuation of our controlling interest in Dempster Mill Manufacturing Company, although developments in recent months point toward a probable higher realization.

附录 B 展示了前期合伙公司的综合业绩。1962 年上半年，是我们历史上表现最好的时期之一，在向合伙人分配收益之前，业绩为负 7.5%，而道琼斯指数的总体业绩为负 21.7%。如果市场在下半年继续下跌，我们 14.2 个百分点的优势可能会进一步扩大；但如果市场回升，优势可能会缩小。请记住我一直的告诫，六个月甚至一年的业绩都不应被过度看重。短期的业绩衡量会夸大表现的偶然波动。虽然上半年的特殊情况带来了异常出色的表现，但肯定也会有我们表现相对较差的时期。我们的业绩数据并未考虑对邓普斯特制造公司控股权估值的变化，不过最近几个月的发展表明，最终实现的价值可能会更高。

_Investment Companies during the First Half:_

_1962 年上半年投资公司表现_

Past letters have stressed our belief that the Dow is no pushover as a yardstick for investment performance. To the extent that funds are invested in common stocks, whether the manner of investment be through investment companies, investment counselors, bank trust departments, or do-it-yourself, our belief is that the overwhelming majority will achieve results roughly comparable to the Dow. Our opinion is that the deviations from the Dow are much more likely to be toward a poorer performance than a superior one.

过去的信件中我一直强调，道琼斯指数作为衡量投资业绩的标准并非轻易就能超越。就资金投资于普通股而言，无论投资方式是通过投资公司、投资顾问、银行信托部门，还是个人自主投资，我认为绝大多数的投资业绩大致与道琼斯指数相当。而且我认为，与道琼斯指数相比，投资业绩更可能是逊于它，而非优于它。

To illustrate this point, we have continually measured the Dow and limited partners' results against the two largest open-end investment companies (mutual funds) following a program of common stock investment and the two largest closed-end investment companies. The tabulation in Appendix C shows the five -years' results, and you will note the figures are extraordinarily close to those of the Dow. These companies have total assets of about $3.5 billion.

为了说明这一点，我们一直将道琼斯指数和有限合伙人的业绩，与两家最大的奉行普通股投资策略的开放式投资公司（共同基金）以及两家最大的封闭式投资公司进行对比。附录 C 中的表格展示了五年的业绩数据，你会注意到这些数据与道琼斯指数的非常接近。这些公司的总资产约为 35 亿美元。

In the interest of getting this letter out promptly, we are mailing it before results are available for the closed-end companies. However, the two mutual funds both did poorer than the Dow, with Massachusetts Investors Trust having a minus 23% overall performance, and Investors Stock Fund realizing a minus 25.4%. This is not unusual as witness the lead article in the WALL STREET JOURNAL of June 13, 1962 headed "Funds vs. Market.” Of the 17 large common stock funds studied, everyone had a record poorer than the Dow from the peak on the Dow of 734, to the date of the article, although in some cases the margin of inferiority was minor.

为了及时发出这封信，在封闭式投资公司的业绩数据出来之前，我们就开始邮寄信件了。不过，两家共同基金的表现都比道琼斯指数差，马萨诸塞投资者信托（Massachusetts Investors Trust）的总体业绩为负 23%，投资者股票基金（Investors Stock Fund）的总体业绩为负 25.4%。这并不罕见，1962 年 6 月 13 日《华尔街日报》一篇题为《基金与市场》的头条文章就可证明。在被研究的 17 家大型普通股基金中，从道琼斯指数达到 734 点的峰值到文章发表之日，每一家的业绩都比道琼斯指数差，尽管在某些情况下，差距较小。

Particularly hard hit in the first half were the so-called “growth” funds which, almost without exception, were down considerably more than the Dow. The three large "growth" (the quotation marks are more applicable now) funds with the best record in the preceding few years, Fidelity Capital Fund, Putnam Growth Fund, and Wellington Equity Fund averaged an overall minus 32.3% for the first half. It is only fair to point out that because of their excellent records in 1959-61, their overall performance to date isstill better than average, as it may well be in the future. Ironically, however, this earlier superior performance had caused such a rush of new investors to come to them that the poor performance this year was experienced by very many more holders than enjoyed the excellent performance of earlier years. This experience tends to confirm my hypothesis that investment performance must be judged over a period of time with such a period including both advancing and declining markets. There will continue to be both; a point perhaps better understood now than six months ago.

上半年受冲击特别严重的是所谓的 “成长型” 基金，几乎无一例外，它们的跌幅都远超道琼斯指数。在过去几年中业绩最佳的三只大型 “成长型”（现在 “成长型” 这个说法可能不太准确了）基金 —— 富达资本基金（Fidelity Capital Fund）、普特南成长基金（Putnam Growth Fund）和惠灵顿股票基金（Wellington Equity Fund），上半年的平均总体跌幅达到 32.3%。需要指出的是，由于它们在 1959 - 1961 年的出色业绩，到目前为止它们的总体表现仍优于平均水平，未来也很可能如此。具有讽刺意味的是，早期的卓越表现吸引了大量新投资者涌入，导致今年业绩不佳时，受影响的投资者数量远远多于享受过早期出色业绩的投资者。这一经历进一步证实了我的观点，即投资业绩必须在一个较长的时间段内进行评判，这个时间段应包括市场的上涨期和下跌期。市场涨跌的情况还会继续交替出现，这一点现在或许比六个月前更容易理解了。

In outlining the results of investment companies, I do so not because we operate in a manner comparable to them or because our investments are similar to theirs. It is done because such funds represent a public batting average of professional, highly-paid investment management handling a very significant $20 billion of securities. Such management, I believe, is typical of management handling even larger sums. As an alternative to an interest in the partnership, I believe it reasonable to assume that many partners would have investments managed similarly.

我之所以概述投资公司的业绩，并非因为我们的运营方式与它们类似，或者我们的投资与它们相似。而是因为这类基金代表了专业、高薪的投资管理行业的公开平均水平，这些机构管理着规模高达 200 亿美元的证券资产。我认为，这类投资管理机构的表现，代表了管理规模更大资金的机构的普遍水平。我认为可以合理假设，许多合伙人如果不投资我们的合伙公司，可能会选择将资金交给投资方式类似的机构管理。

_Asset Values:_

_资产价值_

The above calculations of results are before allocation to the General Partner and monthly payments to partners. Of course, whenever the overall results for the year are not plus 6% on a market value basis (with deficiencies carried forward) there is no allocation to the General Partner. Therefore,  non-withdrawing partners have had a decrease in their market value equity during the first six months of 7.5% and partners who have withdrawn at the rate of 6% per annum have had a decrease in their market value equity during the first half of 10.5%. Should our results for the year be less than plus 6% (and unless there should be a material advance in the Dow, this is very probable) partners receiving monthly payments will have a decrease in their market value equity at December 31, 1962. This means that monthly payments at 6% on this new market equity next year will be on a proportionately reduced basis. For example, if our results were an overall minus 7% for the year, a partner receiving monthly payments who had a market value interest of $100,000 on January 1, 1962 would have an equity at December 31, 1962 of $87,000. This reduction would arise from the minus 7% result, or $7, 000 plus monthly payments of $500 for an additional $6,000. Thus, with $87,000 of market equity on January 1, 1963, monthly payments next year would be $435.00. 

上述业绩计算是在向普通合伙人分配收益和向合伙人每月支付款项之前进行的。当然，只要某一年按市值计算的总体业绩未达到 6%（不足部分会结转至下一年），普通合伙人就不会获得分配。因此，在 1962 年上半年，未提款的合伙人其市值权益下降了 7.5%，而按每年 6% 的比例提款的合伙人，其市值权益在上半年下降了 10.5%。如果我们全年的业绩低于 6%（除非道琼斯指数大幅上涨，否则这种可能性很大），那么每月领取款项的合伙人在 1962 年 12 月 31 日的市值权益将会减少。这意味着，明年按这一新市值权益的 6% 进行的月度支付将相应减少。例如，如果我们全年的业绩为负 7%，一位在 1962 年 1 月 1 日市值权益为 10 万美元、每月领取款项的合伙人，到 1962 年 12 月 31 日时，其权益将变为 8.7 万美元。这一减少是由于负 7% 的业绩（即 7000 美元）加上每月 500 美元、总计 6000 美元的提款。因此，1963 年 1 月 1 日市值权益为 8.7 万美元时，明年每月的支付金额将为 435 美元。

None of the above, of course, has any applicability to advance payments received during 1962 which do not participate in profits or losses, but earn a straight 6%.

当然，上述情况不适用于 1962 年收到的预付款项，这些款项不参与利润或亏损分配，仅按 6% 的固定利率赚取收益。

November 1, 1962 

1962 年 11 月 1 日

#### TO MY PARTNERS FOR 1963:

#### 致 1963 年合伙人

Here we go on the annual paper flurry. Two copies of an amended partnership agreement for 1963 are enclosed. The one with the General Provisions attached is to be kept by you and the other single-page agreement should be returned. There are no substantive changes of any sort from last year's agreement. This amendment is merely to allow for a few new partners and in several places to reword in clearer (we hope) language provisions of the present agreement. Practically all of the rewording is in General Provision 5 (paragraph 7 in last year's agreement). Rather than have a separate amending document, we have incorporated the changes into one complete document embodying the entire agreement.

又到了一年一度文件纷飞的时候。随信附上两份 1963 年修订后的合伙协议。附有一般条款的那份由你留存，另一份单页协议请寄回。与去年的协议相比，没有实质性的变化。此次修订仅是为了接纳几位新合伙人，并在一些地方用更清晰（我们希望如此）的语言重新表述现有协议的条款。实际上，大部分的措辞修改都在一般条款 5（去年协议的第 7 段）。为了避免单独的修订文件，我们将修改内容整合到了一份完整的协议文件中。

We are also enclosing two commitment letters (one for you--one to be returned) on which you are to indicate your wishes regarding additions or withdrawals at January 1st. We would like to have the agreement and the commitment letter back by December 1st. However, the commitment letter can be amended right up until the end of the year (not after) so if you should have a change of plans and you have already mailed us your commitment letter, all you have to do is get in touch with me, and I will make whatever changes you desire. 

我们还附上了两份承诺书（一份给你留存，一份请寄回），你需要在上面注明 1 月 1 日时追加或撤回投资的意向。希望你能在 12 月 1 日前寄回协议和承诺书。不过，承诺书在年底前（不能超过年底）都可以修改。所以，如果你改变了计划，且已经把承诺书寄给我们，只需与我联系，我会按你的要求进行修改。

Any withdrawals will be paid immediately after January 1st. Any additions must reach us by January 10th, and should they be paid in during November, they will take on the status of advance payments and draw interest at the rate of 6% until yearend.

任何撤回的投资将在 1 月 1 日后立即支付。任何追加投资必须在 1 月 10 日前到账，如果在 11 月支付，将作为预付款处理，年底前按 6% 的利率计息。

Please be sure the signature on your partnership agreement is notarized. Partners in Omaha may obtain the notarization at our office if they wish. Also, be sure to let us know by an appropriate circle on the commitment letter whether you wish to receive monthly payments in 1963. In order to be sure everyone understands this, let me again state that these monthly payments are in no sense guaranteed earnings or anything of the sort. They represent a convenient form of regular withdrawal, which to the extent we earn better than 6% are payments from earnings, and to the extent we don't, are payments from capital. 

请确保你在合伙协议上的签名经过公证。奥马哈的合伙人如果愿意，可以在我们办公室进行公证。另外，请在承诺书上相应的位置圈选，告知我们你是否希望在 1963 年每月领取款项。为确保大家都理解这一点，我再次说明，这些月度支付款项绝非保证收益或类似的东西。它们只是一种方便的定期提款方式，如果我们的年收益超过 6%，这些款项来自收益；如果未达到 6%，则部分或全部来自本金。

Complete tax information for your 1962 return will be in your hands by January 20th. If you should need an estimate of your tax position before that time, let me know and I will give you a rough idea. We will also send out a short letter on taxes in late December.

1962 年纳税申报所需的完整税务信息将在 1 月 20 日前送达你手中。如果你在此之前需要预估纳税情况，请告知我，我会给你一个大致的估算。12 月下旬我们还会寄出一封关于税务的简短信件。

Having read this far, you are entitled to a report on how we have done to date in 1962. For the periodending October 31st, the Dow-Jones Industrials showed an overall loss, including dividends received, of approximately 16.8%. We intend to use the same method or valuing our controlling interest in Dempster Mill Manufacturing at this yearend that we did at the end of last year. This involved applying various discounts to the balance sheet items to reflect my opinion as to what could be realized on a very prompt sale. Last year this involved a 40% discount on inventories, a 15% discount on receivables, estimated auction value of fixed assets, etc., which led to an approximate value or $35.00 per share.

读到这里，你有权了解我们 1962 年至今的业绩情况。截至 10 月 31 日，道琼斯工业指数包括股息在内的总体损失约为 16.8%。今年年底，我们打算沿用去年年底评估邓普斯特磨坊制造公司控股权的方法。当时，我对资产负债表上的各项资产进行了不同程度的折扣，以反映我对快速出售时可实现价值的判断。去年，存货按 40% 折扣，应收账款按 15% 折扣，固定资产按预估拍卖价值计算，最终得出每股价值约为 35 美元。

The successful conversion of substantial portions of the assets of Dempster to cash, at virtually 100 cents on the dollar, has been the high point of 1962. For example, inventory of $4.2 million at last yearend will probably be about $1.9 million this yearend, reducing the discount on this item by about $920,000 (40% of $2.3 million reduction). I will give this story my full journalistic treatment in my annual letter. Suffice to say at this point that applying the same discounts described above will probably result in a yearend value of at least $50.00 per share. The extent of the asset conversion job can perhaps best be illustrated in a sentence by pointing out that whereas we had $166,000 of cash and $2,315,000 of liabilities at November 30, 1961 (Dempster fiscal yearend), we expect this year to have about $1 million in cash and investments (of the type the Partnership buys) against total liabilities of $250,000. Prospects for further improvement in this situation in 1963 appear good, and we expect a substantially expanded investment portfolio in Dempster next year. 

1962 年的亮点是成功将邓普斯特的大量资产变现，几乎实现了全额价值。例如，去年年底 420 万美元的存货，今年年底可能降至 190 万美元左右，这使得该项资产的折扣减少了约 92 万美元（存货减少 230 万美元的 40%）。在年度信件中，我会详细讲述这个故事。目前可以说，按照上述同样的折扣方法计算，今年年底每股价值可能至少为 50 美元。资产变现工作的成效可以用一句话说明：1961 年 11 月 30 日（邓普斯特财年结束日），我们持有 16.6 万美元现金，负债 231.5 万美元；预计今年我们将持有约 100 万美元现金和投资（与合伙公司投资类型相同），而总负债仅 25 万美元。1963 年这种情况进一步改善的前景良好，我们预计明年邓普斯特的投资组合规模将大幅扩大。

Valuing Dempster at $50 per share, our overall gain (before any payments to partners) to October 31st for the Partnership has been 5.5%. This 22.3 percentage-points advantage over the Dow, if maintained until the end of the year, will be among the largest we have ever had. About 60% of this advantage was accomplished by the portfolio other than Dempster, and 40% was the result of increased value at Dempster.

将邓普斯特的股票估值为每股 50 美元，截至 10 月 31 日，合伙公司总体收益（在向合伙人支付任何款项之前）为 5.5% 。如果到年底我们仍能保持比道琼斯指数高 22.3 个百分点的优势，这将是我们有史以来最大的优势之一。这一优势约 60% 来自邓普斯特以外的投资组合，40% 来自邓普斯特的价值增长。

I want all partners and prospective partners to realize the results described above are distinctly abnormal and will recur infrequently, if at all. This performance is mainly the result of having a large portion of our money in controlled assets and workout situations rather than general market situations at a time when the Dow declined substantially. If the Dow had advanced materially in 1962, we could have looked very bad on a relative basis, and our success to date in 1962 certainly does not reflect any ability on my part to guess the market (I never try), but merely reflects the fact that the high prices of generals partially forced me into other categories or investment. If the Dow had continued to soar, we would have been low man on the totem pole. We fully expect to have years when our method of operation will not even match the results of the Dow, although obviously I don't expect this on any long-term basis or I would throw in the towel and buy the Dow.

我希望所有合伙人及潜在合伙人明白，上述业绩极为反常，即便出现，也不会频繁。这样的业绩主要是因为在道琼斯指数大幅下跌时，我们的大量资金投资于控股资产和特殊投资机会，而非普通市场投资。如果 1962 年道琼斯指数大幅上涨，我们的相对表现可能会很糟糕。我们在 1962 年至今的成功，并不代表我有预测市场的能力（我从不尝试预测市场），只是因为普通股的高价迫使我转向其他投资类别。如果道琼斯指数继续飙升，我们可能会表现垫底。我们完全预料到，在某些年份，我们的投资方式甚至无法跑赢道琼斯指数，不过显然我不认为长期会如此，否则我就会放弃，转而投资道琼斯指数相关产品。

I’ll cut this sermon short with the conclusion that I certainly do not want anyone to think that the pattern of the last few years is likely to be repeated; I expect future performance to reflect much smaller advantages on average over the Dow.

我不再赘述，只想强调，我不希望任何人认为过去几年的模式会重演；我预计未来我们的业绩平均优势会比道琼斯指数小得多。

#### The Ground Rules

#### 基本原则

Some partners have confessed (that's the proper word) that they sometimes find it difficult to wade through my entire annual letter. Since I seem to be getting more long-winded each year, I have decided to emphasize certain axioms on the first pages. Everyone should be entirely clear on these points. To most of you this material will seem unduly repetitious, but I would rather have nine partners out of ten mildly bored than have one out of ten with any basic misconceptions.

一些合伙人坦言（这个词很恰当），有时他们觉得很难读完我的年度信件全文。鉴于我似乎一年比一年啰嗦，我决定在开头几页强调一些基本原则。每个人都应该清楚这些要点。对你们大多数人来说，这些内容可能显得过于重复，但我宁愿让十分之九的合伙人稍感厌烦，也不愿让十分之一的人存在基本误解。

1. In no sense is any rate of return guaranteed to partners. Partners who withdraw one-half of 1% monthly are doing just that--withdrawing. If we earn more than 6% per annum over a period of years, the withdrawals will be covered by earnings and the principal will increase. If we don't earn 6%, the monthly payments are partially or wholly a return of capital. 

我们绝不向合伙人保证任何收益率。每月提取 0.5% 资金的合伙人，只是在提款。如果多年来我们的年收益率超过 6%，提款将从收益中支出，本金也会增加。如果收益率未达 6%，每月支付的款项则部分或全部来自本金。

2. Any year in which we fail to achieve at least a plus 6% performance will be followed by a year when partners receiving monthly payments will find those payments lowered. 

任何一年，只要我们的业绩未能至少达到 6% 的正收益，接下来一年，每月领取款项的合伙人会发现领取金额降低。

3. Whenever we talk of yearly gains or losses, we are talking about market values; that is, how we stand with assets valued at market at yearend against how we stood on the same basis at the beginning of the year. This may bear very little relationship to the realized results for tax purposes in a given year. 

我们所说的年度盈亏，都是按市值计算的，即年末资产市值与年初同口径市值的比较。这与特定年份纳税申报时的实际收益可能相差甚远。

4. Whether we do a good job or a poor job is not to be measured by whether we are plus or minus for the year. It is instead to be measured against the general experience in securities as measured by the Dow-Jones Industrial Average, leading investment companies, etc. If our record is better than that of these yardsticks, we consider it a good year whether we are plus or minus. If we do poorer, we deserve the tomatoes.

判断我们工作好坏，不是看当年收益是正还是负，而是与道琼斯工业平均指数、主要投资公司等衡量的证券市场总体表现相比。如果我们的业绩优于这些基准，无论当年收益正负，我们都认为是好年份。反之，我们就该接受批评。

5. While I much prefer a five-year test, I feel three years is an absolute minimum for judging performance. It is a certainty that we will have years when the partnership performance is poorer, perhaps substantially so, than the Dow. If any three-year or longer period produces poor results, we all should start looking around for other places to have our money. An exception to the latter statement would be three years covering a speculative explosion in a bull market. 

虽然我更倾向于用五年时间来评估业绩，但我认为三年是评判业绩的最短期限。可以肯定的是，我们会有业绩比道琼斯指数差的年份，甚至可能差距很大。如果任何三年或更长时间的业绩都很差，我们都应该考虑把钱投到其他地方。不过，如果这三年处于牛市投机热潮期，则属例外。

6. I am not in the business of predicting general stock market or business fluctuations. If you think I can do this, or think it is essential to an investment program, you should not be in the partnership.

我不会预测股市大盘或商业波动。如果你认为我能做到，或者认为这对投资至关重要，那你就不应该加入合伙公司。

7. I cannot promise results to partners. What I can and do promise is that: 

我无法向合伙人承诺业绩，但我可以并确实承诺：

   1. Our investments will be chosen on the basis of value, not popularity; 

    我们选择投资基于价值，而非市场热度；

   2. That we will attempt to bring risk of permanent capital loss (not short-term quotational loss) to an absolute minimum by obtaining a wide margin of safety in each commitment and a diversity of commitments; and

    我们会通过在每项投资中获取足够的安全边际和分散投资，将永久资本损失（而非短期股价波动损失）的风险降至最低；

   3. My wife, children and I will have virtually our entire net worth invested in the partnership.

    我的妻子、孩子和我几乎将全部净资产都投入了合伙公司。

_Our Performance in 1962_

_1962 年业绩_

I have consistently told partners that we expect to shine on a relative basis during minus years for the Dow, whereas plus years of any magnitude may find us blushing. This held true in 1962.

我一直告诉合伙人，当道琼斯指数下跌时，我们的相对表现有望出色；而在道琼斯指数大幅上涨的年份，我们可能表现欠佳。1962 年正是如此。

Because of a strong rally in the last few months, the general market as measured by the Dow really did not have such a frightening decline as many might think. From 731 at the beginning of the year, it dipped to 535 in June, but closed at 652. At the end of 1960, the Dow stood at 616, so you can see that while there has been a good deal of action the past few years, the investing public as a whole is not too far from where it was in 1959 or 1960. If one had owned the Dow last year (and I imagine there are a few people playing the high flyers of 1961 who wish they had), they would have had a shrinkage in market value of 79.04 or 10.8%. However, dividends of approximately 23.30 would have been received to bring the overall results from the Dow for the year to minus 7.6%. Our own overall record was plus 13.9%. Below we show the year-by-year performance of the Dow, the partnership before allocation to the general partner, and the limited partners' results for all full years of Buffett Partnership, Ltd.'s and predecessor partnerships' activities:

由于过去几个月市场强劲反弹，以道琼斯指数衡量的大盘跌幅并没有很多人想象的那么可怕。从年初的 731 点跌至 6 月的 535 点，但年末收于 652 点。1960 年底，道琼斯指数为 616 点，所以可以看出，尽管过去几年市场波动较大，但总体而言，投资者的状况与 1959 年或 1960 年相比并没有太大变化。如果有人去年持有道琼斯指数成分股（我想，那些在 1961 年追逐热门股的人现在可能希望自己当初持有了），其市值会缩水 79.04 点，跌幅为 10.8% 。不过，大约 23.30 美元的股息会使道琼斯指数当年的总体收益变为负 7.6% 。我们的总体业绩为正 13.9% 。以下展示道琼斯指数、合伙公司（向普通合伙人分配前）以及巴菲特合伙有限公司和前期合伙公司所有完整年度有限合伙人的逐年业绩：

下表展示了上述三类业绩的累积或复合结果，以及平均年复合增长率：

| Year |  Overall Results from Dow | Partnership Results | Limited Partners Results |
| 年份 |  道琼斯指数总体收益 | 合伙公司业绩 | 有限合伙人业绩 |
| 1957 |  -8.4% | 10.4% | 9.3% | 
| 1957-58 | 26.9% | 55.6% | 44.5% | 
| 1957-59 | 52.3% | 95.9% | 74.7% | 
| 1957-60 | 42.9% | 140.6% | 107.2% | 
| 1957-61 | 74.9% | 251.0% | 181.6% | 
| 1957-62 | 61.6% | 299.8% | 215.1% | 
| Annual Compounded Rate 平均年复合增长率 | 8.3% | 26.0% | 21.1% |

My (unscientific) opinion is that a margin of ten percentage points per annum over the Dow is the very maximum that can be achieved with invested funds over any long period of years, so it may be well to mentally modify some of the above figures.

我（非科学的）观点是，长期来看，每年比道琼斯指数多 10 个百分点的收益是投资资金所能达到的最大优势，所以或许应该对上述部分数据进行适当调整。

Partners have sometimes expressed concern as to the effect of size upon performance. This subject was reflected upon in last year’s annual letter. The conclusion reached was that there were some situations where larger sums helped and some where they hindered, but on balance, I did not feel they would penalize performance. I promised to inform partners if my conclusions on this should change. At the beginning of 1957, combined limited partnership assets totaled $303,726 and grew to $7,178,500 at the beginning or 1962. To date, anyway, our margin over the Dow has indicated no tendency to narrow as funds increase.

合伙人有时会担心公司规模对业绩的影响。去年的年度信件讨论过这个问题，结论是在某些情况下，资金规模较大有帮助，而在另一些情况下则会有阻碍，但总体而言，我认为规模不会对业绩产生负面影响。我承诺过，如果我在这方面的结论发生变化，会告知合伙人。1957 年初，有限合伙公司的总资产为 303,726 美元，到 1962 年初增长至 7,178,500 美元。至少到目前为止，随着资金增加，我们与道琼斯指数的业绩优势并没有缩小的趋势。

_Investment Companies_

_投资公司_

Along with the results of the Dow, we have regularly included the tabulations on the two largest open-end investment companies (mutual funds) following a common stock policy, and the two largest diversified closed end investment companies. These four companies, Massachusetts Investors Trust, Investors Stock Fund, Tri Continental Corp. and Lehman Corp. manage over $3 billion and are probably typical of most of the $20 billion investment company industry. My opinion is that their results parallel those of most bank trust departments and investment counseling organizations which handle, in aggregate, vastly greater sums.

除了道琼斯指数的业绩，我们还定期列出两家奉行普通股投资策略的最大开放式投资公司（共同基金）以及两家最大的多元化封闭式投资公司的业绩数据。这四家公司，即马萨诸塞投资者信托、投资者股票基金、三角大陆公司和雷曼公司，管理着超过 30 亿美元的资产，可能代表了规模达 200 亿美元的投资公司行业的大多数情况。我认为，它们的业绩与大多数银行信托部门和投资咨询机构类似，而这些机构管理的资金总额要大得多。

The purpose of this tabulation, which is shown below, is to illustrate that the Dow is no pushover as an index of investment achievement. The advisory talent managing just the four companies shown commands annual fees of approximately $7 million and this represents a very small fraction of the industry. Nevertheless, the public batting average of this highly-paid talent indicates results slightly less favorable than the Dow. In no sense is this statement intended as criticism. Within their institutional framework and handling the many billions of dollars involved, I consider such average results virtually the only possible ones. Their merits lie in other than superior results.

以下列出这些数据，是为了说明道琼斯指数并非轻易就能超越的投资业绩指标。仅管理这四家公司的投资顾问团队，每年收取的费用就约 700 万美元，这只是整个行业费用的一小部分。然而，这些高薪专业人士的公开平均业绩却略逊于道琼斯指数。我这样说并非批评，在他们的机构框架内，管理着巨额资金，取得这样的平均业绩几乎是必然的。他们的优势并不在于卓越的业绩表现。

Both our portfolio and method of operation differ substantially from the companies mentioned above. However, most partners, as an alternative to their interest in the partnership would probably have their funds invested in media producing results comparable with investment companies, and I, therefore feel they offer a meaningful test of performance.

我们的投资组合和运营方式与上述公司有很大差异。不过，大多数合伙人如果不投资我们的合伙公司，很可能会将资金投入业绩与投资公司相当的机构，因此我认为这些公司的业绩是衡量我们表现的有效参照。

_The Joys of Compounding_

_复合增长的魔力_

I have it from unreliable sources that the cost of the voyage Isabella originally underwrote for Columbus was approximately $30,000. This has been considered at least a moderately successful utilization of venture capital. Without attempting to evaluate the psychic income derived from finding a new hemisphere, it must be pointed out that even had squatter's rights prevailed, the whole deal was not exactly another IBM. Figured very roughly, the $30,000 invested at 4% compounded annually would have amounted to something like $2,000,000,000,000 (that's $2 trillion for those of you who are not government statisticians) by 1962. Historical apologists for the Indians of Manhattan may find refuge in similar calculations. Such fanciful geometric progressions illustrate the value of either living a long time, or compounding your money at a decent rate. I have nothing particularly helpful to say on the former point.

我从不可靠的渠道得知，伊莎贝拉最初资助哥伦布航海的费用约为 3 万美元。这至少被认为是对风险资本较为成功的运用。暂且不评估发现新大陆带来的精神收益，必须指出的是，即便按照 “先占先得” 的原则，这次投资也远不及投资 IBM。粗略计算一下，如果这 3 万美元以每年 4% 的复利投资，到 1962 年大约会增值到 2 万亿美元（如果不是政府统计人员，可能对这个数字没概念）。为曼哈顿印第安人进行历史辩护的人，或许能从类似计算中找到慰藉。这些夸张的几何级数增长，说明了长寿或者以合理利率进行复利投资的价值。关于前者，我没什么有用的建议。

The following table indicates the compounded value of $100,000 at 5%, 10% and 15% for 10, 20 and 30 years. It is always startling to see how relatively small differences in rates add up to very significant sums over a period of years. That is why, even though we are shooting for more, we feel that a few percentage points advantage over the Dow is a very worthwhile achievement. It can mean a lot of dollars over a decade or two.

下表展示了 10 万美元分别按 5%、10% 和 15% 的利率，投资 10 年、20 年和 30 年的复利价值。多年来，利率上相对较小的差异能累积成巨大的金额，总是令人惊讶。这就是为什么，尽管我们追求更高的收益，但仍认为比道琼斯指数多几个百分点的优势是非常了不起的成就。在一二十年的时间里，这可能意味着巨额财富。

| 期限 | 5% | 10% | 15% |
| 10 Years | $162,889 | $259,374 | $404,553 |
| 20 Years | $265,328 | $672,748 | $1,636,640 |
| 30 Years | $432,191 | $1,744,930 | $6,621,140 |

_Our Method of Operation_

_我们的投资方式_

Our avenues of investment break down into three categories. These categories have different behavior characteristics, and the way our money is divided among them will have an important effect on our results, relative to the Dow, in any given year. The actual percentage division among categories is to some degree planned, but to a great extent, accidental, based upon availability factors.

我们的投资渠道分为三类。这三类投资具有不同的表现特征，在任何一年，资金在它们之间的分配方式都会对我们相对于道琼斯指数的业绩产生重要影响。各类投资的实际占比在一定程度上是预先规划的，但很大程度上也受投资机会的影响，具有偶然性。

The first section consists of generally undervalued securities (hereinafter called “generals”) where we have nothing to say about corporate policies and no timetable as to when the undervaluation may correct itself .Over the years, this has been our largest category of investment, and more money has been made here than in either of the other categories. We usually have fairly large positions (5% to 10% of our total assets) in each of five or six generals, with smaller positions in another ten or fifteen.

第一类是普遍被低估的证券（以下简称 “普通股”），对于这类投资，我们无法影响公司决策，也无法确定其估值何时会恢复正常。多年来，这一直是我们最大的投资类别，从中获得的收益比其他两类都多。我们通常会在五六只普通股上持有较大仓位（占总资产的 5% 至 10%），另外还会在十到十五只普通股上持有较小仓位。

Sometimes these work out very fast; many times they take years. It is difficult at the time of purchase to know any compelling reason why they should appreciate in price. However, because of this lack of glamour or anything pending which might create immediate favorable market action, they are available at very cheap prices. A lot of value can be obtained for the price paid. This substantial excess of value creates a comfortable margin of safety in each transaction. Combining this individual margin of safety with a diversity of commitments creates a most attractive package of safety and appreciation potential. We do not go into these generals with the idea of getting the last nickel, but are usually quite content selling out at some intermediate level between our purchase price and what we regard as fair value to a private owner.

有时这些投资很快就能获利；但很多时候，需要数年时间。在买入时，很难找到它们价格上涨的充分理由。然而，正是因为缺乏吸引力，也没有能立即推动市场上涨的因素，它们的价格才非常低廉。投资者能以较低价格获得很高的价值。这种价值的大幅溢价为每笔交易提供了安全边际。将这种单个投资的安全边际与多元化投资相结合，就构成了一个极具吸引力的投资组合，兼具安全性和增值潜力。我们投资普通股时，并不期望赚取最后一分钱，通常在买入价和我们认为的私人所有者眼中的公允价值之间的某个中间价位卖出，就会感到很满足。

Many times generals represent a form of "coattail riding" where we feel the dominating stockholder group has plans for the conversion of unprofitable or under-utilized assets to a better use. We have done that ourselves in Sanborn and Dempster, but everything else equal we would rather let others do the work. Obviously, not only do the values have to be ample in a case like this, but we also have to be careful whose coat we are holding. 

很多时候，投资普通股就像是 “搭便车”，我们认为控股股东有计划将无利可图或未充分利用的资产转化为更有效的用途。我们在桑伯恩地图公司（Sanborn）和邓普斯特公司都这么做过，但在其他条件相同的情况下，我们更愿意让别人去做这些工作。显然，在这种情况下，不仅资产价值要足够高，我们还得谨慎选择 “搭谁的便车”。

The generals tend to behave market-wise very much in sympathy with the Dow. Just because something is cheap does not mean it is not going to go down. During abrupt downward movements in the market, this segment may very well go down percentage-wise just as much as the Dow. Over a period of years, I believe the generals will outperform the Dow, and during sharply advancing years like 1961. This is the section of our portfolio that turns in the best results. It is, of course, also the most vulnerable in a declining market, and in 1962, not only did we not make any money out of our general category, but I am even doubtful if it did better than the Dow.

普通股在市场表现上往往与道琼斯指数高度相关。仅仅因为某只股票价格便宜，并不意味着它不会下跌。在市场突然下跌时，这类投资的跌幅很可能与道琼斯指数相当。但从长期来看，我相信普通股的表现会优于道琼斯指数，比如在 1961 年这样的大幅上涨年份。在我们的投资组合中，普通股在这类年份的表现最佳。当然，在市场下跌时，它也是最脆弱的。1962 年，我们不仅在普通股投资上没有盈利，我甚至怀疑其表现是否优于道琼斯指数。

Our second category consists of "work-outs. These are securities whose financial results depend on corporate action rather than supply and demand factors created by buyers and sellers of securities. In other words, they are securities with a timetable where we can predict, within reasonable error limits, when we will get how much and what might upset the applecart. Corporate events such as mergers, liquidations, reorganizations, spin-offs, etc., I lead to work-outs. An important source in recent years has been sell-outs by oil producers to major integrated oil companies.

第二类是 “特殊情况投资”。这类证券的财务回报取决于公司行为，而非证券买卖双方创造的供求因素。换句话说，这类投资有明确的时间表，我们能在合理误差范围内预测何时能获得多少收益，以及可能出现哪些影响因素。公司的合并、清算、重组、分拆等事件都能带来特殊情况投资机会。近年来，一个重要的投资机会来源是石油生产商向大型综合石油公司的出售交易。

This category will produce reasonably stable earnings from year to year, to a large extent irrespective of the course of the Dow. Obviously, if we operate throughout a year with a large portion of our portfolio in work-outs, we will look extremely good if it turns out to be a declining year for the Dow, or quite bad if it is a strongly advancing year.

这类投资每年能产生相对稳定的收益，在很大程度上不受道琼斯指数走势的影响。显然，如果我们在某一年将大部分投资组合投入特殊情况投资，当道琼斯指数下跌时，我们的表现会非常出色；但如果市场大幅上涨，我们的表现可能会很差。

We were fortunate in that we had a good portion of our portfolio in work outs in 1962. As I have said before, this was not due to any notion on my part as to what the market would do, but rather because I could get more of what I wanted in this category than in the generals. This same concentration in work-outs hurt our performance during the market advance in the second half of the year.

1962 年，我们很幸运，投资组合中有很大一部分是特殊情况投资。我之前说过，这并非因为我对市场走势有先见之明，而是因为在这类投资中，我能找到更多符合要求的机会，比普通股投资机会更多。同样是因为这类投资过于集中，在下半年市场上涨时，我们的业绩受到了影响。

Over the years, work-outs have provided our second largest category. At any given time, we may be in five to ten of these; some just beginning and others in the late stage of their development. I believe in using borrowed money to offset a portion of our work-out portfolio, since there is a high degree of safety in this category in terms of both eventual results and intermediate market behavior. For instance, you will note when you receive our audit report, that we paid $75,000 of interest to banks and brokers during the year. Since our borrowing was at approximately 5%, this means we had an average of $1,500,000 borrowed from such sources. Since 1962 was a down year in the market, you might think that such borrowing would hurt results. However, all of our loans were to offset work-outs, and this category turned in a good profit for the year. Results, excluding the benefits derived from the use of borrowed money, usually fall in the 10% to 20% per annum range. My self-imposed standard limit regarding borrowing is 25% of partnership net worth, although something extraordinary could result in modifying this for a limited period of time.

多年来，特殊情况投资一直是我们的第二大投资类别。在任何时候，我们可能同时参与五到十个这类项目，有些刚刚开始，有些则已进入后期阶段。我认为可以用借款来对冲部分特殊情况投资组合，因为从最终结果和中期市场表现来看，这类投资的安全性很高。比如，当你收到审计报告时会发现，我们当年向银行和经纪商支付了 7.5 万美元利息。由于我们的借款利率约为 5%，这意味着我们平均从这些渠道借款 150 万美元。由于 1962 年是市场下跌年份，你可能认为借款会影响业绩。然而，我们所有借款都是为了对冲特殊情况投资，而这类投资在当年获得了可观的利润。排除借款带来的收益，特殊情况投资的年回报率通常在 10% 至 20% 之间。我给自己设定的借款上限是合伙公司净资产的 25%，不过在特殊情况下，这个限制可能会在短期内调整。

You will note on our yearend balance sheet (part of the audit you will receive) securities sold short totaling some $340,000. Most of this occurred in conjunction with a work-out entered into late in the year. In this case, we had very little competition for a period of time and were able to create a 10% or better profit (gross, not annualized) for a few months tie-up of money. The short sales eliminated the general market risk.

在我们的年终资产负债表（你将收到的审计报告的一部分）上，你会看到卖空证券的总额约为 34 万美元。这主要是在当年年末进行的一项特殊情况投资中产生的。在那段时间里，竞争较少，我们得以通过几个月的资金占用实现 10% 甚至更高的利润（毛利润，未年化）。卖空操作消除了一般市场风险。

The final category is I “control” situations, where we either control the company or take a very large position and attempt to influence policies of the company. Such operations should definitely be measured on the basis of several years. In a given year, they may produce nothing as it is usually to our advantage to have the stock be stagnant market-wise for a long period while we are acquiring it. These situations, too, have relatively little in common with the behavior of the Dow. Sometimes, of course, we buy into a general with the thought in mind that it might develop into a control situation. If the price remains low enough for a long period, this might very well happen. Usually, it moves up before we have a substantial percentage of the company's stock, and we sell at higher levels and complete a successful general operation.

最后一类是 “控股型投资”，即我们要么控制一家公司，要么持有大量股份并试图影响公司政策。这类投资显然应该以数年为周期来衡量。在某一年，它们可能不会产生任何收益，因为在我们收购股份的很长一段时间内，股价保持停滞通常对我们有利。这类投资与道琼斯指数的表现也没有太多关联。当然，有时我们买入一只普通股时，会考虑它是否有可能发展成为控股型投资。如果股价长期保持低位，这种情况很可能发生。但通常在我们获得公司大量股份之前，股价就会上涨，我们会在较高价位卖出，完成一次成功的普通股投资操作。

_Dempster Mill Manufacturing Company_

_邓普斯特制造公司_

The high point of 1962 from a performance standpoint was our present control situation --73% owned Dempster Mill. Dempster has been primarily in farm implements (mostly items retailing for $1,000 or under), water systems, water well supplies and jobbed plumbing lines.

从业绩角度来看，1962 年的亮点是我们目前控股的邓普斯特磨坊制造公司，我们持有其 73% 的股份。邓普斯特主要经营农业机械（大多是零售价在 1000 美元以下的产品）、供水系统、水井设备以及管道产品的批发业务。

The operations for the past decade have been characterized by static sales, low inventory turnover and virtually no profits in relation to invested capital.

过去十年，该公司的经营特点是销售额停滞不前、库存周转率低，相对于投入的资本而言，几乎没有利润。

We obtained control in August, 1961 at an average price of about $28 per share, having bought some stock as low as $16 in earlier years, but the vast majority in an offer of $30.25 in August. When control of a company is obtained, obviously what then becomes all-important is the value of assets, not the market quotation for a piece of paper (stock certificate).

1961 年 8 月，我们以平均每股约 28 美元的价格获得了该公司的控制权，早些年我们曾以低至 16 美元的价格买入部分股票，但大部分股份是以 8 月份每股 30.25 美元的报价购入的。当获得一家公司的控制权后，显然最重要的就是资产的价值，而不是一张纸（股票凭证）的市场报价。

Last year, our Dempster holding was valued by applying what I felt were appropriate discounts to the various assets. These valuations were based on their status as non-earning assets and were not assessed on the basis of potential, but on the basis of what I thought a prompt sale would produce at that date. Our job was to compound these values at a decent rate. The consolidated balance sheet last year and the calculation of fair value are shown below. (000’s omitted)

去年，我们对持有的邓普斯特股票进行估值时，对各项资产进行了我认为合适的折价处理。这些估值是基于资产当时不盈利的状况，并非基于其潜在价值，而是基于我对当时快速出售所能获得价值的判断。我们的任务是以合理的利率使这些价值实现复利增长。以下是去年的合并资产负债表以及公允价值的计算。（单位：千美元，省略）

Dempster's fiscal year ends November 30th, and because the audit was unavailable in complete form, I approximated some of the figures and rounded to $35 per share last year.

邓普斯特的财年截止到 11 月 30 日，由于当时无法获得完整的审计报告，我对部分数据进行了估算，并将每股价值四舍五入到 35 美元。

Initially, we worked with the old management toward more effective utilization of capital, better operating margins, reduction of overhead, etc. These efforts were completely fruitless. After spinning our wheels for about six months, it became obvious that while lip service was being given to our objective, either through inability or unwillingness, nothing was being accomplished. A change was necessary.

起初，我们与原管理层合作，试图更有效地利用资本、提高运营利润率、降低管理费用等。但这些努力完全没有成效。在白费力气约六个月后，很明显，虽然他们口头上认同我们的目标，但由于能力不足或不愿意，没有取得任何实际成果。变革势在必行。

A good friend, whose inclination is not toward enthusiastic descriptions, highly recommended Harry Bottle for our type of problem. On April 17, 1962 I met Harry in Los Angeles, presented a deal which provided for rewards to him based upon our objectives being met, and on April 23rd he was sitting in the president's chair in Beatrice.

一位不太会说溢美之词的好朋友，极力向我推荐哈里・博特尔（Harry Bottle）来解决我们的问题。1962 年 4 月 17 日，我在洛杉矶与哈里见面，提出了一项激励方案，根据目标完成情况给予他相应奖励。4 月 23 日，他就坐上了位于比阿特丽斯的公司总裁的位置。

Harry is unquestionably the man of the year. Every goal we have set for Harry has been met, and all the surprises have been on the pleasant side. He has accomplished one thing after another that has been labeled as impossible, and has always taken the tough things first. Our breakeven point has been cut virtually in half, slow-moving or dead merchandise has been sold or written off, marketing procedures have been revamped, and unprofitable facilities have been sold.

毫无疑问，哈里是年度最佳人物。我们为他设定的每一个目标都实现了，而且所有的结果都超出预期。他完成了一件又一件被认为不可能的事情，总是先从最棘手的问题入手。我们的盈亏平衡点几乎减半，滞销或积压的商品要么被售出，要么被核销，营销流程得到了改进，不盈利的业务也被出售。

The results of this program are partially shown in the balance sheet below, which, since it still represents non-earning assets, is valued on the same basis as last year. (000’s omitted)

以下资产负债表部分展示了这些措施的成果。由于这些资产仍未产生收益，因此估值方法与去年相同。（单位：千美元，省略）

| Total Assets 总资产 | $4,423 |  | $3,471 | Adjusted value per share 	调整后每股价值 | $51.26 | 

Three facts stand out: (1) Although net worth has been reduced somewhat by the housecleaning and writedowns ($550,000 was written out of inventory; fixed assets overall brought more than book value), we have converted assets to cash at a rate far superior to that implied in our year-earlier valuation. (2) To some extent, we have converted the assets from the manufacturing business (which has been a poor business) to a business which we think is a good business --securities. (3) By buying assets at a bargain price, we don't need to pull any rabbits out of a hat to get extremely good percentage gains. This is the cornerstone of our investment philosophy: “Never count on making a good sale. Have the purchase price be so attractive that even a mediocre sale gives good results. The better sales will be the frosting on the cake.”

有三个事实值得关注：第一，尽管通过清理资产和减记（存货减记 55 万美元；固定资产整体售价高于账面价值），净资产有所减少，但我们将资产变现的速度远远超过了去年估值时的预期。第二，在一定程度上，我们将资产从制造业（这是一个表现不佳的行业）转移到了我们认为前景更好的证券投资领域。第三，通过以低价买入资产，我们无需依赖运气就能获得极高的回报率。这是我们投资理念的基石：“永远不要指望通过出色的卖出获利。确保买入价格足够诱人，这样即使是普通的卖出也能带来不错的收益。而出色的卖出则是锦上添花。”

On January 2, 1963, Dempster received an unsecured term loan of $1,250,000. These funds, together with the funds all ready "freed-up" will enable us to have a security portfolio of about $35 per share at Dempster, or considerably more than we paid for the whole company. Thus our present valuation will involve a net of about $16 per share in the manufacturing operation and $35 in a security operation comparable to that of Buffett Partnership, Ltd.

1963 年 1 月 2 日，邓普斯特获得了一笔 125 万美元的无担保定期贷款。这些资金加上已经 “释放” 的资金，将使邓普斯特的证券投资组合价值达到每股约 35 美元，这比我们收购整个公司的成本还要高。因此，我们目前对邓普斯特的估值相当于制造业业务每股净值约 16 美元，以及与巴菲特合伙有限公司类似的证券投资业务每股 35 美元。

We, of course, are devoted to compounding the $16 in manufacturing at an attractive rate and believe we have some good ideas as to how to accomplish this. While this will be easy if the business as presently conducted earns money, we have some promising ideas even if it shouldn't.

当然，我们致力于以有吸引力的利率使制造业业务的 16 美元实现复利增长，并且相信我们有一些可行的方案来实现这一目标。如果目前的业务能够盈利，这将很容易实现；即便业务不盈利，我们也有一些颇具前景的想法。

It should be pointed out that Dempster last year was 100% an asset conversion problem and therefore, completely unaffected by the stock market and tremendously affected by our success with the assets. In 1963, the manufacturing assets will still be important, but from a valuation standpoint it will behave considerably more like a general since we will have a large portion of its money invested in generals pretty much identical with those in Buffett Partnership, Ltd. For tax reasons, we will probably not put workouts in Dempster. Therefore, if the Dow should drop substantially, it would have a significant effect on the Dempster valuation. Likewise, Dempster would benefit this year from an advancing Dow which would not have been the case most of last year.

需要指出的是，去年邓普斯特完全是一个资产转换问题，因此完全不受股市影响，而极大地受我们资产运作成功与否的影响。1963 年，制造业资产仍然重要，但从估值角度来看，它的表现将更像一只普通股，因为我们会将其大部分资金投资于与巴菲特合伙有限公司类似的普通股。出于税务方面的考虑，我们可能不会在邓普斯特进行特殊情况投资。因此，如果道琼斯指数大幅下跌，将会对邓普斯特的估值产生重大影响。同样，今年如果道琼斯指数上涨，邓普斯特也将受益，而去年大部分时间并非如此。

There is one final point of real significance for Buffett Partnership, Ltd. We now have a relationship with an operating man which could be of great benefit in future control situations. Harry had never thought of running an implement company six days before he took over. He is mobile, hardworking and carries out policies once they are set. He likes to get paid well for doing well, and I like dealing with someone who is not trying to figure how to get the fixtures in the executive washroom gold-plated.

对于巴菲特合伙有限公司而言，还有一点非常重要。我们现在与一位运营人才建立了良好的关系，这在未来的控股型投资中可能会带来巨大的好处。在接管邓普斯特之前，哈里从未想过要经营一家农机公司。他行动敏捷、勤奋努力，一旦制定了政策就会坚决执行。他希望因出色的工作获得丰厚的回报，而我也喜欢与那些不会想着给高管洗手间的固定装置镀金的人打交道。

Harry and I like each other, and his relationship with Buffett Partnership, Ltd. should be profitable for all of us.

哈里和我彼此欣赏，他与巴菲特合伙有限公司的合作关系对我们所有人来说都应该是有利可图的。

_The Question of Conservatism_

_保守投资的问题_

Because I believe it may be even more meaningful after the events of 1962 I would like to repeat this section from last year’s letter:

鉴于 1962 年的市场情况，我认为重复去年信件中的这部分内容可能更有意义：

"The above description of our various areas of operation may provide some clues as to how conservatively our portfolio is invested. Many people some years back thought they were behaving in the most conservative manner by purchasing medium or long-term municipal or government bonds. This policy has produced substantial market depreciation in many cases, and most certainly has failed to maintain or increase real buying power.

“上述对我们各类投资领域的描述，或许能让你了解我们投资组合的保守程度。多年前，许多人认为购买中期或长期市政债券或政府债券是最保守的投资方式。但在很多情况下，这种策略导致了大幅的市场价值贬值，而且肯定无法维持或增加实际购买力。

"Conscious, perhaps overly conscious, of inflation, many people now feel that they are behaving in a conservative manner by buying blue chip securities almost regardless of price-earnings ratios, dividend yields, etc. Without the benefit of hindsight as in the bond example, I feel this course of action is fraught with danger. There is nothing at all conservative, in my opinion, about speculating as to just how high a multiplier a greedy and capricious public will put on earnings.

由于意识到（或许是过度意识到）通货膨胀，现在许多人认为，几乎不考虑市盈率、股息率等因素购买蓝筹股就是保守投资。与债券投资的例子不同，由于无法事后诸葛亮，我认为这种投资方式充满风险。在我看来，猜测贪婪且反复无常的公众会给收益赋予多高的估值乘数，根本算不上保守投资。

You will not be right simply because a large number of people momentarily agree with you. You will not be right simply because important people agree with you. In many quarters the simultaneous occurrence of the two above factors is enough to make a course of action meet the test of conservatism. “You will be right, over the course of many transactions, if your hypotheses are correct, your facts are correct, and your reasoning is correct. True conservatism is only possible through knowledge and reason.

仅仅因为很多人一时认同你的观点，并不意味着你就是正确的。仅仅因为重要人物认同你，也不意味着你就是正确的。在很多情况下，上述两个因素同时出现，就足以让一种投资行为被视为保守投资。但实际上，在众多交易中，只有当你的假设正确、事实准确、推理合理时，你才会是正确的。真正的保守投资只有通过知识和理性才能实现。”

I might add that in no way does the fact that our portfolio is not conventional prove that we are more conservative or less conservative than standard methods of investing. This can only be determined by examining the methods or examining the results.

我还想补充一点，我们的投资组合不符合常规，这并不能证明我们比传统投资方式更保守或更不保守。这只能通过研究投资方法或评估投资结果来判断。

I feel the most objective test as to just how conservative our manner of investing is arises through evaluation of performance in down markets. Preferably these should involve a substantial decline in the Dow. Our performance in the rather mild declines of 1957 and 1960 would confirm my hypothesis that we invest in an extremely conservative manner. I would welcome any partner's suggesting objective tests as to conservatism to see how we stack up. We have never suffered a realized loss of more than ½ of 1% of total net assets and our ratio of total dollars of realized gains to total realized losses is something like 100 to 1. Of course, this reflects the fact that on balance we have been operating in an up market. However there have been many opportunities for loss transactions even in markets such as these (you may have found out about a few of these yourselves) so I think the above facts have some significance.

我认为，评估我们投资方式保守程度的最客观标准，是看市场下跌时的业绩表现。最好是道琼斯指数大幅下跌的情况。我们在 1957 年和 1960 年相对温和的市场下跌中的表现，证实了我认为我们投资方式极为保守的观点。我欢迎任何合伙人提出评估保守程度的客观标准，看看我们的表现如何。我们从未遭受过超过总资产净值 0.5% 的实际损失，而且我们的总实现收益与总实现损失之比约为 100 比 1。当然，这反映出总体而言我们是在牛市中运营。然而，即使在这样的市场中，也有很多可能导致亏损的交易机会（你们自己可能也遇到过一些），所以我认为上述事实还是有一定意义的。

In 1962, we did realize a loss on one commitment or 1.0% and our ratio or realized gains to losses was only slightly over 3 to 1. However, compared to more conventional (often termed conservative which is not synonymous) methods of common stock investing, it would appear that our method involved considerably less risk. Our advantage over the Dow was all achieved when the market was going down; we lost a bit of this edge on the way up.

1962 年，我们在一项投资上确实遭受了 1.0% 的损失，实现收益与损失之比仅略高于 3 比 1。不过，与更传统（通常被称为保守，但并不准确）的普通股投资方式相比，我们的投资方式风险似乎要小得多。我们在市场下跌时获得了超越道琼斯指数的优势；在市场上涨过程中，我们的这一优势有所削弱。

_The Usual Prediction_

一如既往的预测

I am certainly not going to predict what general business or the stock market are going to do in the next year or two, since I don't have the faintest idea.

我当然不会预测未来一两年内整体商业形势或股市的走势，因为我完全没有头绪。

I think you can be quite sure that over the next ten years, there are going to be a few years when the general market is plus 20% or 25% a few when it is minus on the same order, and a majority when it is in between. I haven’t any notion as to the sequence in which these will occur, nor do I think it is of any great importance for the long-term investor. If you will take the first table on page 3 and shuffle the years around, the compounded result will stay the same. If the next four years are going to involve, say, a +40%, -30%, +10% and –6%, the order in which they fall is completely unimportant for our purposes as long as we all are around at the end of the four years. Over a long period of years, I think it likely that the Dow will probably produce something like 5% per year compounded from a combination of dividends and market value gain. Despite the experience of the last decade, anyone expecting substantially better than that from the general market probably faces disappointment.

我认为你可以十分确定，在未来十年里，会有几年股市大盘上涨 20% 或 25%，也会有几年下跌相同幅度，而大多数年份涨跌幅度介于两者之间。我不清楚这些情况出现的先后顺序，而且我认为这对长期投资者来说也并非至关重要。如果你把第 3 页的第一张表格中的年份打乱顺序，复合结果不会改变。比如，如果未来四年的市场走势分别是上涨 40%、下跌 30%、上涨 10% 和下跌 6%，只要四年后我们都还在，那么这些涨跌出现的顺序对我们来说完全无关紧要。在任何较长的时间段内，我认为道琼斯指数很可能会通过股息和市值增长的综合作用，实现每年约 5% 的复合增长率。尽管过去十年市场表现有所不同，但任何期望股市大盘表现大幅优于这一水平的人，可能都会失望。

Our job is to pile up yearly advantages over the performance of the Dow without worrying too much about whether the absolute results in a given year are a plus or a minus. I would consider a year in which we were down 15% and the Dow declined 25% to be much superior to a year when both the partnership and the Dow advanced 20%.

我们的工作是每年都要在业绩上超越道琼斯指数，而不必过于担心某一年的绝对业绩是正还是负。我会认为，在我们下跌 15% 而道琼斯指数下跌 25% 的年份，要比我们和道琼斯指数都上涨 20% 的年份好得多。

For the reasons outlined in our method of operation, our best years relative to the Dow are likely to be in declining or static markets. Therefore, the advantage we seek will probably come in sharply varying amounts. There are bound to be years when we are surpassed by the Dow, but if over a long period we can average ten percentage points per year better than it, I will feel the results have been satisfactory.

基于我运营方法中概述的原因，相对于道琼斯指数，我们表现最佳的年份很可能出现在市场下跌或平稳时期。因此，我们所追求的优势幅度可能会有很大差异。必然会有一些年份，我们的表现不如道琼斯指数，但如果从长期来看，我们每年平均能比它高出 10 个百分点，我就会认为结果是令人满意的。

Specifically, if the market should be down 35% or 40% in a year (and I feel this has a high probability of occurring one year in the next ten --no one knows which one), we should be down only 15% or 20%. If it is more or less unchanged during the year, we would hope to be up about ten percentage points. If it is up 20% or more, we would struggle to be up as much. It is certainly doubtful we could match a 20% or 25% advance from the December 31, 1962 level. The consequence of performance such as this over a period of years would mean that if the Dow produces a 5% per year overall gain compounded, I would hope our results might be 15% per year.

具体来说，如果某一年市场下跌 35% 或 40%（我觉得在未来十年里，很有可能会有这样一年 —— 没人知道是哪一年），我们的跌幅应该只有 15% 或 20%。如果当年市场基本持平，我们希望能上涨约 10 个百分点。如果市场上涨 20% 或更多，我们会努力跟上涨幅。从 1962 年 12 月 31 日的水平来看，我们能否实现 20% 或 25% 的涨幅还很难说。如果多年来都保持这样的表现，那就意味着，如果道琼斯指数每年实现 5% 的复合总涨幅，我希望我们的业绩能达到每年 15%。

The above expectations may sound somewhat rash, and there is no question but that they may appear very much so when viewed from the vantage point of 1965 or 1970. Variations in any given year from the behavior described above would be wide, even if the long-term expectation was correct. Certainly, you have to recognize the possibility of substantial personal bias in such hopes.

上述预期听起来可能有些草率，从 1965 年或 1970 年的角度来看，这些预期无疑会显得非常草率。即使长期预期是正确的，在任何一年，实际表现与上述预期的差异也可能很大。当然，你必须认识到，这些预期可能存在个人主观因素。

_Miscellaneous_

_其他事项_

This year marked the transition from the office off the bedroom to one a bit (quite a bit) more conventional. Surprising as it may seem, the return to a time clock life has not been unpleasant. As a matter of fact, I enjoy not keeping track of everything on the backs of envelopes.

今年，我完成了办公室的搬迁，从卧室旁边的小空间搬到了一个更常规（大得多）的办公室。令人惊讶的是，回归朝九晚五的工作节奏并不让人讨厌。事实上，我很享受不再在信封背面记录各种事项的生活。

We are starting off this year with net assets of $9,405,400.00. At the start of 1962, Susie and I had three “nonmarketable security” investments of other than nominal size, and two of these have been sold. The third will be continued indefinitely. From the proceeds of the two sales, we have added to our partnership interest so that we now have an interest of $1,377,400.00. Also, my three children, mother, father, two sisters, two brothers-in-law, father-in-law, three aunts, four cousins, five nieces and nephews have interests directly or indirectly totaling $893,600.00.

今年年初，我们的净资产为 9405400 美元。1962 年初，我和苏茜持有三项规模不小的 “非上市证券” 投资，其中两项已经出售。第三项会无限期持有。我们用这两项投资的收益增加了在合伙公司的份额，现在我们的份额价值达到 1377400 美元。此外，我的三个孩子、母亲、父亲、两个姐妹、两个姐夫、岳父、三个姑姑、四个表亲、五个侄子侄女直接或间接持有合伙公司的份额，总价值为 893600 美元。

Bill Scott who has fit into our operation splendidly has an interest (with his wife) of $167,400.00; A very large portion of his net worth. So we are all eating our own cooking.

比尔・斯科特（Bill Scott）很好地融入了我们的团队，他和妻子在合伙公司的份额价值为 167400 美元，这占了他净资产的很大一部分。所以，我们都在 “吃自己做的饭”，与大家共担风险。

You will note from the auditor's certificate that they made a surprise check during the year and this will be a continuing part of their procedure. Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co. again did an excellent job on the audit, meeting our rather demanding time schedules.

从审计师的证明中你会看到，他们在当年进行了一次突击检查，而且这将成为他们的常规工作。皮特・马威克・米切尔会计师事务所（Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co.）在审计工作中再次表现出色，满足了我们苛刻的时间要求。

Susie was in charge of equipping the office which means we did not follow my “orange crate" approach to interior decorating. We have an ample supply of Pepsi on hand and look forward to partners dropping in.

苏茜负责办公室的装修布置，这意味着我们没有采用我那 “用橘子箱当家具” 的室内装饰风格。我们备有充足的百事可乐，期待合伙人来访。

Beth Feehan continues to demonstrate why she is the high priestess of the CPS (certified professional secretary, that is) group.

贝丝・费汉（Beth Feehan）继续证明了她为何是注册专业秘书群体中的佼佼者。

Partners did a wonderful job of cooperating in the return of agreements and commitment letters, and I am most appreciative of this. It makes life a lot easier. Enclosed you will find Schedule “A” to your partnership agreement. You will be receiving your audit and tax figures very soon, and if you have questions on any of this be sure to let me hear from you.

合伙人在寄回协议和承诺书方面配合得非常好，我对此深表感激。这让工作轻松了许多。随信附上你的合伙协议附表 A。你很快就会收到审计报告和税务数据，如果有任何疑问，请务必告诉我。

BUFFETT PARTNERSHIP, LTD.

巴菲特合伙有限公司

810 KIEWIT PLAZA OMAHA 31, NEBRASKA

内布拉斯加州奥马哈市基威特广场 810 号

July 10, 1963

1963 年 17 月 10 日

#### First Half Performance

#### 上半年业绩表现

During the first half of 1963, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (hereinafter called the "Dow") advanced from 652.10 to 706.88. If one had owned the Dow during this period, dividends of $10.66 would have been received, bringing the overall return from the Dow during the first half to plus 10.0%.

1963 年上半年，道琼斯工业平均指数（以下简称 “道指”）从 652.10 点上涨至 706.88 点。如果有人在这一时期持有道指成分股，将获得 10.66 美元的股息，这使得道指上半年的总回报率达到了 10.0%。

Our incantation has been: (1) that short-term results (less than three years) have little meaning, particularly in reference to an investment operation such as ours that devotes a portion of resources to control situations, and;(2) That our results relative to the Dow and other common-stock-form media, will be better in declining markets and may well have a difficult time just matching such media in bubbling markets.

我们一直秉持的理念是：（1）短期业绩（少于三年）意义不大，尤其是对于像我们这样将部分资源投入到控制权交易情况的投资操作而言；（2）相对于道指和其他普通股投资方式，我们的业绩在市场下跌时会表现得更好，而在市场泡沫阶段，可能很难与这些投资方式的表现相匹敌。

Nevertheless, our first-half performance, excluding any change in Dempster valuation (and its valuation did change --I'm saving this for dessert later in the letter) was plus 14%. This 14% is computed on total net assets (not non-Dempster assets) and is after expenses, but before monthly payments (to those who take them) to partners and allocation to the General Partner. Such allocations are academic on an interim basis, but if we were also plus 14% at yearend, the first 6% would be allocated to partners according to their capital, plus threequarters of the balance of 8% (14% -6%), or an additional 6%, giving the limited partners a plus 12% performance.

尽管如此，不考虑登普斯特公司估值的任何变化（其估值确实发生了变化 —— 我会在信的后面再谈这个有趣的部分），我们上半年的业绩回报率为 14%。这 14% 是基于净资产总额计算的（并非不包括登普斯特公司的资产），且已扣除费用，但尚未扣除每月向合伙人支付的款项（如果合伙人有此要求的话）以及向普通合伙人的分配。在中期来看，这些分配只是理论上的计算，但如果到年底我们的回报率仍为 14%，那么前 6% 将根据合伙人的出资比例进行分配，另外 8%（14% - 6%）的四分之三，即额外的 6%，有限合伙人的业绩回报率将达到 12%。

Despite the relatively pleasant results of the first half the admonitions stated two paragraphs earlier hold in full force. At plus 14% versus plus 10% for the Dow, this six months has been a less satisfactory period than the first half of 1962 when we were minus 7.5% versus minus 21.7% for the Dow. You should completely understand our thinking in this regard which has been emphasized in previous letters.

尽管上半年取得了相对不错的业绩，但在前两段中提到的告诫仍然完全适用。我们的回报率为 14%，而道指为 10%，这六个月的表现不如 1962 年上半年。在 1962 年上半年，我们的回报率为 - 7.5%，而道指为 - 21.7%。您应该完全理解我们在这方面的想法，这在之前的信件中也已强调过。

During the first half we had an average net investment in "generals" (long positions in generals minus short positions in generals) of approximately $5,275,000. Our overall gain from this net investment in generals (for a description of our investment categories see the last annual letter) was about $1,100,000 for a percentage gain from this category of roughly 21%. This again illustrates the extent to which the allocation of our resources among various categories affects short-term results. In 1962 the generals were down for the year and only an outstanding performance by both of the other two categories, "work-outs" and "controls," gave us our unusually favorable results for that year.

上半年，我们在 “一般投资”（一般多头头寸减去一般空头头寸）方面的平均净投资额约为 527.5 万美元。我们从这一 “一般投资” 净投资中获得的总收益（关于我们的投资类别描述，请参阅上一份年度信函）约为 110 万美元，该类别的收益率约为 21%。这再次表明，我们在不同投资类别之间的资源配置对短期业绩的影响程度。1962 年，“一般投资” 全年表现不佳，正是另外两类投资 “套利投资” 和 “控制权投资” 的出色表现，才使我们在那一年取得了异常优异的业绩。

Now this year, our work-outs have done poorer than the Dow and have been a drag on performance, as they are expected to be in rising markets. While it would be very nice to be 100% in generals in advancing markets and 100% in work-outs in declining markets, I make no attempt to guess the course of the stock market in such a manner. We consider all three of our categories to be good businesses on a long-term basis, although their short-term price behavior characteristics differ substantially in various types of markets. We consider attempting to gauge stock market fluctuations to be a very poor business on a long-term basis and are not going to be in it, either directly or indirectly through the process of trying to guess which of our categories is likely to do best in the near future.

今年，我们的 “套利投资” 表现比道指差，并且对整体业绩产生了拖累，这在市场上涨时是预料之中的。虽然在市场上涨时 100% 投资于 “一般投资”，在市场下跌时 100% 投资于 “套利投资” 是非常理想的情况，但我不会试图以这种方式去猜测股市的走势。从长期来看，我们认为这三类投资都是不错的业务，尽管它们在不同类型市场中的短期价格表现特征有很大差异。我们认为，试图预测股市波动从长期来看是一项非常糟糕的业务，我们不会直接或间接地参与其中，也不会试图猜测我们的哪类投资在近期可能表现最佳。

The results continue to show that the most highly paid and respected investment advice has difficulty matching the performance of an unmanaged index of blue-chip stocks. This in no sense condemns these institutions or the investment advisers and trust departments whose methods, reasoning, and results largely parallel such investment companies. These media perform a substantial service to millions of investors in achieving adequate diversification, providing convenience and peace of mind, avoiding issues of inferior quality, etc. However, their services do not include (and in the great majority of cases, are not represented to include) the compounding of money at a rate greater than that achieved by the general market.

这些结果继续表明，那些收费最高且备受尊敬的投资建议，在与一个未经管理的蓝筹股指数的表现相匹配时存在困难。这绝不是在谴责这些机构或投资顾问以及信托部门，他们的方法、推理和业绩在很大程度上与这类投资公司类似。这些投资方式为数百万投资者在实现充分分散投资、提供便利和安心保障、避免劣质投资项目等方面提供了重要服务。然而，他们的服务并不包括（而且在绝大多数情况下，也并未声称包括）以高于总体市场的回报率实现资金的复利增长。

Our partnership's fundamental reason for existence is to compound funds at a better-than-average rate with less exposure to long-term loss of capital than the above investment media. We certainly cannot represent that we will achieve this goal. We can and do say that if we don't achieve this goal over any reasonable period excluding an extensive speculative boom, we will cease operation.

我们合伙企业存在的根本原因，是要以高于平均水平的回报率实现资金的复利增长，并且与上述投资方式相比，承担的长期资本损失风险更低。我们当然不能保证一定能实现这一目标。但我们可以且确实说过，如果在任何合理的时期内（不包括大规模的投机热潮时期）我们没有实现这一目标，我们将停止运营。

In our most recent annual letter, I described Harry Bottle as the “man of the year”. If this was an understatement.

在我们最近的年度信函中，我将哈里・博特尔（Harry Bottle）描述为 “年度风云人物”。如果说这还有所保留的话。

Last year Harry did an extraordinary job of converting unproductive assets into cash which we then, of course, began to invest in undervalued securities. Harry has continued this year to turn under-utilized assets into cash, but in addition, he has made the remaining needed assets productive. Thus we have had the following transformation in balance sheets during the last nineteen months:

去年，哈里在将无利可图的资产转化为现金方面做出了非凡的工作，随后我们当然开始将这些现金投资于被低估的证券。今年，哈里继续将未充分利用的资产转化为现金，但除此之外，他还使剩余的必要资产发挥了效益。因此，在过去的 19 个月里，我们的资产负债表发生了如下变化：

I have included above the conversion factors we have previously used in valuing Dempster for B.P.L. purposes to reflect estimated immediate sale values of non-earning assets.

我已在上面列出了我们之前为了巴菲特合伙公司（B.P.L.）对登普斯特公司进行估值时所使用的换算系数，以反映非盈利资产的预计即时出售价值。

As can be seen, Harry has converted the assets at a much more favorable basis than was implied by my valuations. This largely reflects Harry's expertise and, perhaps, to a minor degree my own conservatism in valuation.

如您所见，哈里在资产转换方面所基于的条件，比我之前估值时所隐含的条件要优惠得多。这在很大程度上体现了哈里的专业能力，或许也在一定程度上反映了我在估值时的保守态度。

As can also be seen, Dempster earned a very satisfactory operating profit in the first half (as well as a substantial unrealized gain in securities) and there is little question that the operating business, as now conducted, has at least moderate earning power on the vastly reduced assets needed to conduct it. Because of a very important-seasonal factor and also the presence of a tax carry forward, however, the earning power is not nearly what might be inferred simply by a comparison of the 11/30/62 and 6/30/63 balance sheets. Partly because of this seasonality, but more importantly, because of possible developments in Dempster before 1963 yearend, we have left our Dempster holdings at the same $51.26 valuation used at yearend 1962 in our figures for B.P.L’s first half. However, I would be very surprised if it does not work out higher than this figure at yearend.

同样可以看到，登普斯特公司在上半年取得了非常可观的营业利润（同时在证券投资方面也有大量未实现的收益），而且毫无疑问，就目前的经营状况而言，这家运营中的企业，在维持经营所需的大幅减少的资产基础上，至少具备适度的盈利能力。然而，由于一个非常重要的季节性因素，以及存在税收结转的情况，其盈利能力远非仅仅通过比较 1962 年 11 月 30 日和 1963 年 6 月 30 日的资产负债表就能推断出来的。部分是由于这种季节性因素，但更重要的是，由于在 1963 年底之前登普斯特公司可能会有一些新的发展情况，在我们计算 B.P.L. 上半年的数据时，我们对持有的登普斯特公司股份的估值仍保持在 1962 年底时的每股 51.26 美元。不过，如果到年底时的实际估值不高于这个数字，我会感到非常惊讶。

One sidelight for the fundamentalists in our group: B.P.L. owns 71.7% of Dempster acquired at a cost of $1,262,577.27. On June 30, 1963 Dempster had a small safe deposit box at the Omaha National Bank containing securities worth $2,028,415.25. Our 71.7% share of $2,028,415.25 amounts to $1,454,373.70. Thus, everything above ground (and part of it underground) is profit. My security analyst friends may find this a rather primitive method of accounting, but I must confess that I find a bit more substance in this fingers and toes method than in any prayerful reliance that someone will pay me 35 times next year's earnings.

对于我们团队中的基本面分析派人士，这里有一个附带信息：B.P.L. 以 1,262,577.27 美元的成本收购了登普斯特公司 71.7% 的股份。1963 年 6 月 30 日，登普斯特公司在奥马哈国民银行有一个小型保险箱，里面存放的证券价值为 2,028,415.25 美元。我们在这 2,028,415.25 美元中所占的 71.7% 的份额价值为 1,454,373.70 美元。因此，所有明面上（甚至部分隐藏的）的收益都是利润。我的那些证券分析师朋友们可能会觉得这种会计核算方法相当原始，但我必须承认，相比于寄希望于有人会以明年收益的 35 倍价格收购我的股份，我觉得这种实实在在的计算方法更靠谱。

_Advance Payments and Advance Withdrawals_

_预付款项和预支提款_

We accept advance payments from partners and prospective partners at 6% interest from date of receipt until the end of the year. While there is no obligation to convert the payment to a partnership interest at the end of the year, this should be the intent at the time of payment.

我们接受合伙人及潜在合伙人的预付款项，从收到款项之日起至当年年底，按 6% 的利率计算利息。虽然在年底时没有义务将预付款项转为合伙份额，但在支付款项时，通常应抱有这样的意向。

Similarly, we allow partners to withdraw up to 20% of their partnership account prior to yearend and charge them 6% from date of withdrawal until yearend when it is charged against their capital account. Again, it is not intended that partners use US like a bank, but that they use the withdrawal right for unanticipated need for funds.

同样，我们允许合伙人在年底前从其合伙账户中提取不超过 20% 的资金，并从提款之日起至年底按 6% 的利率计息，年底时从其资本账户中扣除相应款项。同样，我们不希望合伙人把我们这里当作银行来使用，而是希望他们在遇到意外的资金需求时才使用提款权利。

The willingness to both borrow and lend at 6% may seem "un-Buffett-like.” We look at the withdrawal right as a means of giving some liquidity for unexpected needs and, as a practical matter, are reasonably sure it will be far more than covered by advance payments.

愿意以 6% 的利率进行借款和贷款，这可能看起来不太 “像巴菲特的风格”。我们把提款权利看作是一种为应对意外资金需求提供一定流动性的方式，而且实际上，我们相当确定预付款项的金额会远远超过预支提款的金额。

Why then the willingness to pay 6% for advance payment money when we can borrow from commercial banks at substantially lower rates? For example, in the first half we obtained a substantial six-month bank loan at 4%. The answer is that we expect on a long-term basis to earn better than 6% (the general partner's allocation is zero unless we do although it is largely a matter of chance whether we achieve the 6% figure in any short period. Moreover, I can adopt a different attitude in the investment of money that can be expected to soon be a part of our equity capital than I can on short-term borrowed money. The advance payments have the added advantage to us of spreading the investment of new money over the year, rather than having it hit us all at once in January. On the other hand, 6% is more than can be obtained in short-term dollar secure investments by our partners, so I consider it mutually profitable. On June 30, 1963 we had advance withdrawals of $21,832.00 and advancepayments of $562,437.11.

那么，既然我们可以从商业银行以低得多的利率借款，为什么还愿意为预付款项支付 6% 的利息呢？例如，上半年我们获得了一笔大额的六个月期银行贷款，利率为 4%。答案是，我们预期从长期来看，我们的投资回报率会高于 6%（除非我们的回报率超过 6%，否则普通合伙人不会获得分配，不过在任何短期内能否达到 6% 的回报率在很大程度上是碰运气的事。此外，对于预计很快会成为我们股权资本一部分的资金，我在投资时可以采取与短期借款不同的态度。预付款项对我们还有一个额外的好处，就是可以将新资金的投资分散到全年，而不是在一月份一下子涌入大量资金。另一方面，我们的合伙人在短期美元安全投资中无法获得 6% 的回报率，所以我认为这对双方都有利。1963 年 6 月 30 日，我们的预支提款金额为 21,832.00 美元，预付款项金额为 562,437.11 美元。

_Taxes_

_税务_

There is some possibility that we may have fairly substantial realized gains this year. Of course, this may not materialize at all and actually does not have anything to do with our investment performance this year. I am an outspoken advocate of paying large amounts of income taxes -- at low rates. A tremendous number of fuzzy, confused investment decisions are rationalized through so-called "tax considerations.”

今年我们有可能会实现相当可观的已实现收益。当然，这也完全有可能不会实现，而且实际上这与我们今年的投资业绩并无关联。我是一个直言不讳的倡导者，主张以低税率缴纳大量的所得税。有大量模糊不清、令人困惑的投资决策，都是通过所谓的 “税务考量” 来合理化的。

My net worth is the market value of holdings less the tax payable upon sale. The liability is just as real as the asset unless the value of the asset declines (ouch), the asset is given away (no comment), or I die with it. The latter course of action would appear to at least border on a Pyrrhic victory.

我的净资产是所持资产的市场价值减去出售资产时应缴纳的税款。这种负债与资产一样真实存在，除非资产价值下降（哎呀）、资产被赠送出去（不予置评），或者我带着资产离世。最后这种做法，看起来至少有点得不偿失。

Investment decisions should be made on the basis of the most probable compounding of after-tax net worth with minimum risk. Any isolation of low-basis securities merely freezes a portion of net worth at a compounding factor identical with the assets isolated. While this may work out either well or badly in individual cases, it is a nullification of investment management. The group experience holding various low basis securities will undoubtedly approximate group experience on securities as a whole, namely compounding at the compounding rate of the Dow. We do not consider this the optimum in after-tax compounding rates.

投资决策应该基于在风险最小的情况下，实现税后净资产最有可能的复利增长。仅仅孤立地持有低成本基数的证券，只会使一部分净资产的复利增长系数与所持有资产的情况相同。虽然在个别情况下，这种做法可能会有好的结果，也可能会有不好的结果，但这实际上是对投资管理的一种否定。持有各种低成本基数证券的群体经验，无疑会与整体证券投资的群体经验大致相近，也就是按照道琼斯指数的复利增长率增长。我们认为这并不是实现税后复利增长率最优的方式。

I have said before that if earnings from the partnership can potentially amount to a sizable portion of your total taxable income, the safe thing to do is to estimate this year the same tax you incurred last year. If you do this, you cannot run into penalties. In any event, tax liabilities for those who entered the partnership on 1/1/63 will be minimal because of the terms of our partnership agreement first allocating capital gains to those having an interest in unrealized appreciation.

我之前曾说过，如果合伙公司的收益有可能在您的应纳税总收入中占相当大的比例，稳妥的做法是今年估算的税额与去年缴纳的税额相同。如果您这样做，就不会面临罚款。无论如何，对于那些在 1963 年 1 月 1 日加入合伙公司的人来说，由于我们合伙协议的条款规定，资本利得首先分配给那些在未实现增值部分拥有权益的人，所以他们的税务负担会很轻。

As in past years, we will have a letter out about November 1st (to partners and those who have indicated an interest to me by that time in becoming partners) with the amendment to the partnership agreement, commitment letter for 1964, estimate of the 1963 tax situation, etc.

和往年一样，我们会在 11 月 1 日左右发出一封信函（致合伙人以及到那时已向我表示有兴趣成为合伙人的人），其中包含合伙协议的修正案、1964 年的承诺书、1963 年税务情况的估算等内容。

My closing plea for questions regarding anything not clear always draws a blank. Maybe no one reads this far. Anyway, the offer is still open. 

我每次最后都恳请大家，如果有任何不明白的地方可以提问，但总是无人回应。也许没人读到这么后面吧。不管怎样，这个提议仍然有效。

Cordially,

诚挚的，

#### To My Partners for 1964:

Enclosed is the usual assortment of Thanksgiving reading material:

(1) Two copies of an amended partnership agreement for 1964. The one with the General Provisions attached is to be kept by you (exactly the same as last year) and the other single page agreement is to be signed, notarized and returned to us. Partners in Omaha may come in and obtain the notarization at our office.
(2) A copy of that priceless treatise, "The Ground Rules,” I would like every partner to read this at least once a year, and it is going to be a regular item in my November package. Don't sign the partnership agreement unless you fully understand the concepts set forth and are in accord with them -- mentally and viscerally.
(3) Two copies of the commitment letter for 1964, one to be kept by you and one returned to us. You may amend this commitment letter right up to midnight, December 31st, so get it back to us early, and if it needs to be changed, just let us know by letter or phone.

Any withdrawals will be paid immediately after January 1st. You may withdraw any amount you desire from $100 up to your entire equity. Similarly, additions can be for any amount and should reach us by January 10th. In the event you are disposing of anything, this will give you a chance to have the transaction in 1964 if that appears to be advantageous for tax reasons. If additions reach us in November, they take on the status of advance payments and draw interest at the rate of 6% until yearend. This is not true of additions reaching us in December.

Complete tax information for your 1963 return will be in your hands by January 25th. If you should need an estimate of your tax position before that time, let me know and I will give you a rough idea. We will also send out a short letter on taxes in late December.

At the end of October, the overall result from the Dow for 1963 was plus 18.8%. We have had a good year in all three categories, generals, work-outs and controls. A satisfactory sale on a going concern basis of Dempster Mill Manufacturing operating assets was made about a month ago. I will give the full treatment to the Dempster story in the annual letter, perhaps climaxed by some lyrical burst such as “Ode to Harry Bottle.” While we always had a built-in profit in Dempster because of our bargain purchase price, Harry accounted for several extra servings of dessert by his extraordinary job. Harry, incidentally, has made an advance payment toward becoming a limited partner in 1964-- we consider this the beginning, not the end.

However, 1963 has not been all Dempster. While a great deal can happen the last two months and therefore interim results should not be taken too seriously, at the end of October the overall gain for the partnership was about 32%. Based on the allocation embodied in our agreement, this works out to plus 25 1/2% for the limited partners before monthly payments to those who take them. Of our approximate $3 million gain, something over $2 million came from marketable securities and a little less than $1 million from Dempster operating assets. The combined gain from our single best general and best work-out situation approximated the gain on the Dempster operating assets.

You should be aware that if our final results relative to the Dow for 1963 are as favorable as on October 31st, I will regard it as an abnormal year. I do not consider a 13.2 percentage point margin to be in the cards on a long term basis. A considerably more moderate annual edge over the Dow will be quite satisfactory.

Cordially

Warren E. Buffett

P/S. Last year we announced there would be no prizes for the last ones to get the material back to us. This continues to be our policy. Save us some last minute scurrying by getting your agreement and commitment letter back pronto. Give Bill or me a call if we can be of any help. Thanks!

#### Our Performance in 1963

1963 was a good year. It was not a good year because we had an overall gain of $3,637,167 or 38.7% on our beginning net assets, pleasant as that experience may be to the pragmatists in our group. Rather it was a good year because our performance was substantially better than that of our fundamental yardstick --the Dow-Jones Industrial Average (hereinafter called the “Dow”). If we had been down 20% and the Dow had been down 30%, this letter would still have begun “1963 was a good year.” Regardless of whether we are plus or minus in a particular year, if we can maintain a satisfactory edge on the Dow over an extended period of time, our long term results will be satisfactory -- financially as well as philosophically.

To bring the record up to date, the following summarizes the year-by-year performance of the Dow, the performance of the Partnership before allocation to the general partner, and the limited partners' results for all full years of BPL's and predecessor partnerships' activities:

|年份（Year）|道琼斯指数总体收益（Overall Results From Dow (1)）|合伙公司业绩（Partnership Results (2)）|有限合伙人业绩（Limited Partners’ Results (3)）|
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
|1957年| -8.4%| 10.4%| 9.3%|
|1958年| 38.5%| 40.9%| 32.2%|
|1959年| 20.0%| 25.9%| 20.9%|
|1960年| -6.2%| 22.8%| 18.6%|
|1961年| 22.4%| 45.9%| 35.9%|
|1962年| -7.6%| 13.9%| 11.9%|
|1963年| 20.7%| 38.7%| 30.5%| 

(1) Based on yearly changes in the value of the Dow plus dividends that would have been received through ownership of the Dow during that year.
(2) For 1957-61 consists of combined results of all predecessor limited partnerships operating throughout the entire year after all expenses but before distributions to partners or allocations to the general partner.
(3) For 1957-61 computed on the basis of the preceding column of partnership results allowing for allocation to the general partner based upon the present partnership agreement.

One wag among the limited partners has suggested I add a fourth column showing the results of the general partner --let's just say he, too, has an edge on the Dow.

The following table shows the cumulative or compounded results based on the preceding table:

|年份（Year）|道琼斯指数总体收益（Overall Results From Dow）|合伙公司业绩（Partnership Results）|有限合伙人业绩（Limited Partners’ Results）|
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
|1957年| -8.4%| 10.4%| 9.3%|
|1957 - 1958年| 26.9%| 55.6%| 44.5%|
|1957 - 1959年| 52.3%| 95.9%| 74.7%|
|1957 - 1960年| 42.9%| 140.6%| 107.2%|
|1957 - 1961年| 74.9%| 251.0%| 181.6%|
|1957 - 1962年| 61.6%| 299.8%| 215.1%|
|1957 - 1963年| 95.1%| 454.5%| 311.2%|
|年复合增长率（Annual Compounded Rate）| 10.0%| 27.7%| 22.3%| 

It appears that we have completed seven fat years. With apologies to Joseph we shall attempt to ignore the biblical script. (I've never gone overboard for Noah's ideas on diversification either.)

In a more serious vein, I would like to emphasize that, in my judgment; our 17.7 margin over the Dow shown above is unattainable over any long period of time. A ten percentage point advantage would be a very satisfactory accomplishment and even a much more modest edge would produce impressive gains as will be touched upon later. This view (and it has to be guesswork -- informed or otherwise) carries with it the corollary that we must expect prolonged periods of much narrower margins over the Dow as well as at least occasional years when our record will be inferior (perhaps substantially so) to the Dow.

Much of the above sermon is reflected in "The Ground Rules" sent to everyone in November, but it can stand repetition.

_Investment Companies_

We regularly compare our results with the two largest open-end investment companies (mutual funds) that follow a policy of being, typically, 95 -100% invested in common stocks, and the two largest diversified closedend investment companies. These four companies, Massachusetts Investors Trust, Investors Stock Fund, TriContinental Corp. and Lehman Corp. manage about $4 billion and are probably typical of most of the $25 billion investment company industry. My opinion is that their results roughly parallel those of the vast majority or other investment advisory organizations which handle, in aggregate, vastly greater sums.

The purpose or this tabulation, which is shown below, is to illustrate that the Dow is no pushover as an index or investment achievement. The advisory talent managing just the four companies shown commands' annual fees of over $7 million, and this represents a very small fraction of the industry. The public batting average of this highly-paid talent indicates they achieved results slightly less favorable than the Dow.

Both our portfolio and method of operation differ substantially from the investment companies in the table. However, most partners, as an alternative to their interest in the Partnership would probably have their funds invested in media producing results comparable with investment companies, and I, therefore, feel they offer a meaningful standard of performance.

The Dow, of course, is an unmanaged index, and it may seem strange to the reader to contemplate the high priests of Wall Street striving vainly to surpass or even equal it. However, this is demonstrably the case. Moreover, such a failure cannot be rationalized by the assumption that the investment companies et al are handling themselves in a more conservative manner than the Dow. As the table above indicates, and as more extensive studies bear out, the behavior of common stock portfolio managed by this group, on average, have declined in concert with the Dow. By such a test of behavior in declining markets, our own methods of operation have proven to be considerably more conservative than the common stock component of the investment company or investment advisor group. While this has been true in the past, there obviously can be no guarantees about the future. 

The above may seem like rather strong medicine, but it is offered as a factual presentation and in no way as criticism. Within their institutional framework and handling the many billions of dollars involved, the results achieved are the only ones attainable. To behave unconventionally within this framework is extremely difficult. Therefore, the collective record of such investment media is necessarily tied to the record of corporate America. Their merits, except in the unusual case, do not lie in superior results or greater resistance to decline in value. Rather, I feel they earn their keep by the ease of handling, the freedom from decision making and the automatic diversification they provide, plus, perhaps most important, the insulation afforded from temptation to practice patently inferior techniques which seem to entice so many world-be investors.

_The Joys of Compounding_

Now to the pulse-quickening portion of our essay. Last year, in order to drive home the point on compounding, I took a pot shot at Queen Isabella and her financial advisors. You will remember they were euchred into such an obviously low-compound situation as the discovery of a new hemisphere.

Since the whole subject of compounding has such a crass ring to it, I will attempt to introduce a little class into this discussion by turning to the art world. Francis I of France paid 4,000 ecus in 1540 for Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa. On the off chance that a few of you have not kept track of the fluctuations of the ecu 4,000 converted out to about $20,000.

If Francis had kept his feet on the ground and he (and his trustees) had been able to find a 6% after-taxinvestment, the estate now would be worth something over $1,000,000,000,000,000.00. That's $1 quadrillion or over 3,000 times the present national debt, all from 6%. I trust this will end all discussion in our household about any purchase or paintings qualifying as an investment.

However, as I pointed out last year, there are other morals to be drawn here. One is the wisdom of living a long time. The other impressive factor is the swing produced by relatively small changes in the rate of compound.

Below are shown the gains from $100,000 compounded at various rates:

| | 4% | 8% | 12% | 16% |
| 10 | Years | $48,024 |$115,892 | $210,584 | $341,143 |
| 20 | Years | $119,111 | $366,094 | $864,627 | $1,846,060 |
| 30 | Years | $224,337 | $906,260 | $2,895,970 | $8,484,940 |

It is obvious that a variation of merely a few percentage points has an enormous effect on the success of a compounding (investment) program. It is also obvious that this effect mushrooms as the period lengthens. If, over a meaningful period of time, Buffett Partnership can achieve an edge of even a modest number of percentage points over the major investment media, its function will be fulfilled.

Some of you may be downcast because I have not included in the above table the rate of 22.3% mentioned on page 3. This rate, of course, is before income taxes which are paid directly by you --not the Partnership. Even excluding this factor, such a calculation would only prove the absurdity of the idea of compounding at very high rates -- even with initially modest sums. My opinion is that the Dow is quite unlikely to compound for any important length of time at the rate it has during the past seven years and, as mentioned earlier, I believe our margin over the Dow cannot be maintained at its level to date. The product of these assumptions would be a materially lower average rate of compound for BPL in the future than the rate achieved to date. Injecting a minus 30% year (which is going to happen from time to time) into our tabulation of actual results to date, with, say, a corresponding minus 40% for the Dow brings both the figures on the Dow and BPL more in line with longer range possibilities. As the compounding table above suggests, such a lowered rate can still provide highly satisfactory long term investment results.

_Our Method of Operation_

At this point I always develop literary schizophrenia. On the one hand, I know that we have in the audience a number of partners to whom details of our business are interesting. We also have a number to whom this whole thing is Greek and who undoubtedly wish I would quit writing and get back to work.

To placate both camps, I am just going to sketch briefly our three categories at this point and those who are interested in getting their doctorate can refer to the appendix for extended treatment of examples.

Our three investment categories are not differentiated by their expected profitability over an extended period of time. We are hopeful that they will each, over a ten or fifteen year period, produce something like the ten percentage point margin over the Dow that is our goal. However, in a given year they will have violently different behavior characteristics, depending primarily on the type of year it turns out to be for the stock market generally. Briefly this is how they shape up:

    “Generals” - A category of generally undervalued stocks, determined primarily by quantitative 
    standards, but with considerable attention also paid to the qualitative factor. There is often little or nothing to indicate immediate market improvement. The issues lack glamour or market sponsorship. Their main qualification is a bargain price; that is, an overall valuation on the enterprise substantially below what careful analysis indicates its value to a private owner to be. Again let me emphasize that while the quantitative comes first and is essential, the qualitative is important. We like good management - we like a decent industry - we like a certain amount of “ferment” in a previously dormant management or stockholder group. But we demand value. The general group behaves very much in sympathy with the Dow and will turn in a big minus result during a year of substantial decline by the Dow. Contrarywise, it should be the star performer in a strongly advancing market. Over the years we expect it, of course, to achieve a satisfactory margin over the Dow.

    “Workouts” - These are the securities with a timetable. They arise from corporate activity - sell-outs, mergers, reorganizations, spin-offs, etc. In this category we are not talking about rumors or "inside information" pertaining to such developments, but to publicly announced activities of this sort. We wait until we can read it in the paper. The risk pertains not primarily to general market behavior (although that is sometimes tied in to a degree), but instead to something upsetting the applecart so that the expected development does not materialize. Such killjoys could include anti-trust or other negative government action, stockholder disapproval, withholding of tax rulings, etc. The gross profits in many workouts appear quite small. A friend refers to this as getting the last nickel after the other fellow has made the first ninety-five cents. However, the predictability coupled with a short holding period produces quite decent annual rates of return. This category produces more steady absolute profits from year to year than generals do. In years of market decline, it piles up a big edge for us; during bull markets, it is a drag on performance. On a long term basis, I expect it to achieve the same sort of margin over the Dow attained by generals.

    “Controls” - These are rarities, but when they occur they are likely to be of significant size. Unless we start off with the purchase of a sizable block or stock, controls develop from the general category. They result from situations where a cheap security does nothing price-wise for such an extended period of time that we are able to buy a significant percentage of the company's stock. At that point we are probably in a position to assume some degree of, or perhaps complete, control of the company's activities; whether we become active or remain relatively passive at this point depends upon our assessment of the company’s future and the management's capabilities. The general we have been buying the most aggressively in recent months possesses excellent management following policies that appear to make very good sense to us. If our continued buying puts us in a controlling position at some point in the future, we will probably remain very passive regarding the operation or this business.

    We do not want to get active merely for the sake of being active. Everything else being equal I would much rather let others do the work. However, when an active role is necessary to optimize the employment of capital you can be sure we will not be standing in the wings.
    
    Active or passive, in a control situation there should be a built-in profit. The sine qua non of this operation is an attractive purchase price. Once control is achieved, the value of our investment is determined by the value of the enterprise, not the oftentimes irrationalities of the marketplace.

    Our willingness and financial ability to assume a controlling position gives us two-way stretch on many purchases in our group of generals. If the market changes its opinion for the better, the security will advance in price. If it doesn't, we will continue to acquire stock until we can look to the business itself rather than the market for vindication of our judgment.
    
    Investment results in the control category have to be measured on the basis of at least several years. Proper buying takes time. If needed, strengthening management, re-directing the utilization of capital, perhaps effecting a satisfactory sale or merger, etc., are also all factors that make this a business to be measured in years rather than months. For this reason, in controls, we are looking for wide margins of profit-if it looks at all close, we pass.

    Controls in the buying stage move largely in sympathy with the Dow. In the later stages their behavior is geared more to that of workouts.

As I have mentioned in the past, the division of our portfolio among the three categories is largely determined by the accident or availability. Therefore, in a minus year for the Dow, whether we are primarily in generals or workouts is largely a matter of luck, but it will have a great deal to do with our performance relative to the Dow. This is one or many reasons why a single year's performance is of minor importance and, good or bad, should never be taken too seriously.

If there is any trend as our assets grow, I would expect it to be toward controls which heretofore have been our smallest category. I may be wrong in this expectation - a great deal depends, of course, on the future behavior of the market on which your guess is as good as mine (I have none). At this writing, we have a majority of our capital in generals, workouts rank second, and controls are third.

_Miscellaneous_

We are starting off the year with net assets of $17,454,900. Our rapid increase in assets always raises the question of whether this will result in a dilution of future performance. To date, there is more of a positive than inverse correlation between size of the Partnership and its margin over the Dow. This should not be taken seriously however. Larger sums may be an advantage at some times and a disadvantage at others. My opinion is that our present portfolio could not be improved if our assets were $1 million or $5 million. Our idea inventory has always seemed to be 10% ahead of our bank account. If that should change, you can count on hearing from me.

Susie and I have an investment of $2,392,900 in the Partnership. For the first time I had to withdraw funds in addition to my monthly payments, but it was a choice of this or disappointing the Internal Revenue Service. Susie and I have a few non-marketable (less than 300 holders) securities of nominal size left over from earlier years which in aggregate are worth perhaps 1% of our partnership interest. In addition we have one non-marketable holding of more material size of a local company purchased in 1960 which we expect to hold indefinitely. Aside from this all our eggs are in the BPL basket and they will continue to be. I can't promise results but I can promise a common destiny. In addition, that endless stream of relatives of mine consisting of my three children, mother, father, two sisters, two brothers-in-law, father-in-law, four aunts four cousins and five nieces and nephews, have interests in BPL directly or indirectly totaling $1,247,190.

Bill Scott is also in with both feet, having an interest along with his wife or $237,400, the large majority or their net worth. Bill has done an excellent job and on several or our more interesting situations going into 1964, he has done the majority or the contact work. I have also shoved off on him as much as possible of the administrative work so if you need anything done or have any questions, don't hesitate to ask for Bill if I'm not around.

Beth and Donna have kept an increasing work load flowing in an excellent manner. During December and January, I am sure they wish they had found employment elsewhere, but they always manage to keep a mountain of work ship-shape.

Peat, Marwick, Mitchell has done their usual excellent job of meeting a tough timetable. We have instructed them to conduct two surprise checks a year (rather than one as in past years) on our securities, cash, etc., in the future. These are relatively inexpensive, and I think make a good deal of sense in any financial organization.

Within the next week you will receive:

(1) A tax letter giving you all BPL information needed for your 1963 federal income tax return. This letter is the only item that counts for tax purposes.
(2) An audit from Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co. for 1963, setting forth the operations and financial position of BPL as well as your own capital account.
(3) A letter signed by me setting forth the status of your BPL interest on 1/1/64. This is identical with the figure developed in the audit.
(4) Schedule “A” to the partnership agreement listing all partners.

Let me know if anything needs clarifying. As we grow, there is more chance of missing letters, a name skipped over, a figure transposition, etc., so speak up if it appears we might have erred. Our next letter will be about July 15th summarizing the first half.

Cordially,

Warren E. Buffett

APPENDIX

TEXAS NATIONAL PETROLEUM

This situation was a run-of-the-mill workout arising from the number one source of workouts in recent years -- the sellouts of oil and gas producing companies.

TNP was a relatively small producer with which I had been vaguely familiar for years.

Early in 1962 I heard rumors regarding a sellout to Union Oil of California. I never act on such information, but in this case it was correct and substantially more money would have been made if we had gone in at the rumor stage rather than the announced stage. However, that's somebody else's business, not mine.

In early April, 1962, the general terms of the deal were announced. TNP had three classes of securities 
outstanding:
(1) 6 1/2% debentures callable at 104 1/4 which would bear interest until the sale transpired and at that time would be called. There were $6.5 million outstanding of which we purchased $264,000 principal amount before the sale closed.
(2) About 3.7 million shares of common stock of which the officers and directors owned about 40%. The proxy statement estimated the proceeds from the liquidation would produce $7.42 per share. We purchased 64,035 shares during the six months or so between announcement and closing.
(3) 650,000 warrants to purchase common stock at $3.50 per share. Using the proxy statement estimate of $7.42 for the workout on the common resulted in $3.92 as a workout on the warrants. We were able to buy 83,200 warrants or about 13% of the entire issue in six months.

The risk of stockholder disapproval was nil. The deal was negotiated by the controlling stockholders, and the price was a good one. Any transaction such as this is subject to title searches, legal opinions, etc., but this risk could also be appraised at virtually nil. There were no anti-trust problems. This absence of legal or anti-trust problems is not always the case, by any means.

The only fly in the ointment was the obtaining of the necessary tax ruling. Union Oil was using a standard ABC production payment method of financing. The University of Southern California was the production payment holder and there was some delay because of their eleemosynary status.

This posed a new problem for the Internal Revenue Service, but we understood USC was willing to waive this status which still left them with a satisfactory profit after they borrowed all the money from a bank. While getting this ironed out created delay, it did not threaten the deal.

When we talked with the company on April 23rd and 24th, their estimate was that the closing would take place in August or September. The proxy material was mailed May 9th and stated the sale "will be consummated during the summer of 1962 and that within a few months thereafter the greater part of the proceeds will be distributed to stockholders in liquidation.” As mentioned earlier, the estimate was $7.42 per share.Bill Scott attended the stockholders meeting in Houston on May 29th where it was stated they still expected to close on September 1st. 

The following are excerpts from some of the telephone conversations we had with company officials in ensuing months:

    On June 18th the secretary stated "Union has been told a favorable IRS ruling has been formulated but must be passed on by additional IRS people. Still hoping for ruling in July.”

    On July 24th the president said that he expected the IRS ruling “early next week.”

    On August 13th the treasurer informed us that the TNP, Union Oil, and USC people were all in Washington attempting to thrash out a ruling.

    On September 18th the treasurer informed us "No news, although the IRS says the ruling could be ready by next week.”

The estimate on payout was still $7.42.

The ruling was received in late September, and the sale closed October 31st. Our bonds were called November 13th. We converted our warrants to common stock shortly thereafter and received payments on the common of $3.50 December 14, 1962, $3.90 February 4, 1963, and 15 cent on April 24, 1963. We will probably get another 4 cent in a year or two. On 147,235 shares (after exercise of warrants) even 4 cent per share is meaningful.

This illustrates the usual pattern: (1) the deals take longer than originally projected; and (2) the payouts tend to average a little better than estimates. With TNP it took a couple of extra months, and we received a couple ofextra percent.

The financial results of TNP were as follows: 

(1) On the bonds we invested $260,773 and had an average holding period of slightly under five months. We received 6 ½% interest on our money and realized a capital gain of $14,446. This works out to an overall rate of return of approximately 20% per annum.
(2) On the stock and warrants we have realized capital gain of $89,304, and we have stubs presently valued at $2,946. From an investment or $146,000 in April, our holdings ran to $731,000 in October. Based on the time the money was employed, the rate or return was about 22% per annum. 

In both cases, the return is computed on an all equity investment. I definitely feel some borrowed money is warranted against a portfolio of workouts, but feel it is a very dangerous practice against generals.

We are not presenting TNP as any earth-shaking triumph. We have had workouts which were much better and some which were poorer. It is typical of our bread-and-butter type of operation. We attempt to obtain all facts ossible, continue to keep abreast of developments and evaluate all of this in terms of our experience. We certainly don't go into all the deals that come along -- there is considerable variation in their attractiveness. When a workout falls through, the resulting market value shrink is substantial. Therefore, you cannot afford many errors, although we fully realize we are going to have them occasionally.

**DEMPSTER MILL MFG.**

This situation started as a general in 1956. At that time the stock was selling at $18 with about $72 in book value of which $50 per share was in current assets (Cash, receivables and inventory) less all liabilities. Dempster had earned good money in the past but was only breaking even currently.

The qualitative situation was on the negative side (a fairly tough industry and unimpressive management), but the figures were extremely attractive. Experience shows you can buy 100 situations like this and have perhaps 70 or 80 work out to reasonable profits in one to three years. Just why any particular one should do so is hard to say at the time of purchase, but the group expectancy is favorable, whether the impetus is from an improved industry situation, a takeover offer, a change in investor psychology, etc.

We continued to buy the stock in small quantities for five years. During most or this period I was a director and was becoming consistently less impressed with the earnings prospects under existing management. However, I also became more familiar with the assets and operations and my evaluation of the quantitative factors remained very favorable.

By mid-1961 we owned about 30% or Dempster (we had made several tender offers with poor results), but in August and September 1961 made, several large purchases at $30.25 per share, which coupled with a subsequent tender offer at the same price, brought our holding to over 70%. Our purchases over the previous five years had been in the $16-$25 range.

On assuming control, we elevated the executive vice president to president to see what he would do unfettered by the previous policies. The results were unsatisfactory and on April 23, 1962 we hired Harry Bottle as president.

Harry was the perfect man for the job. I have recited his triumphs before and the accompanying comparative balance sheets speak louder than any words in demonstrating the re-employment of capital.

Harry:
(1) took the inventory from over $4 million (much of it slow moving) to under $1 million reducing carrying 
costs and obsolescence risks tremendously;
(2) correspondingly freed up capital for marketable security purchases from which we gained over $400,000
(3) cut administration and selling expense from $150,000 to $75,000 per month;
(4) cut factory overhead burden from $6 to $4.50 per direct labor hour;
(5) closed the five branches operating unprofitably (leaving us with three good ones) and replaced them with more productive distributors;
(6) cleaned up a headache at an auxiliary factory operation at Columbus, Nebraska;
(7) eliminated jobbed lines tying up considerable money (which could be used profitably in securities) while producing no profits;
(8) adjusted prices of repair parts, thereby producing an estimated $200,000 additional profit with virtually no loss of volume; and most important;
(9) through these and many other steps, restored the earning capacity to a level commensurate with the capital employed.

In 1963, the heavy corporate taxes we were facing (Harry surprised me by the speed with which he had earned up our tax loss carry-forward) coupled with excess liquid funds within the corporation compelled us to either in some way de-incorporate or to sell the business.

We set out to do either one or the other before the end of 1963. De-incorporating had many problems but would have, in effect, doubled earnings for our partners and also eliminated the problem of corporate capital gain tax on Dempster securities.

At virtually the last minute, after several earlier deals had fallen through at reasonably advanced stages, a sale of assets was made. Although there were a good many wrinkles to the sale, the net effect was to bring approximately book value. This, coupled with the gain we have in our portfolio of marketable securities, gives us a realization of about $80 per share. Dempster (now named First Beatrice Corp. - we sold the name to the new Co.) is down to almost entirely cash and marketable securities now. On BPL's yearend audit, our First Beatrice holdings were valued at asset value (with securities at market) less a $200,000 reserve for various contingencies.

I might mention that we think the buyers will do very well with Dempster. They impress us as people of ability and they have sound plans to expand the business and its profitability. We would have been quite happy to operate Dempster on an unincorporated basis, but we are also quite happy to sell it for a reasonable price. Our business is making excellent purchases -- not making extraordinary sales.

Harry works the same way I do -- he likes big carrots. He is presently a limited partner of BPL, and the next belt-tightening operation we have, he's our man.

The Dempster saga points up several morals:

(1) Our business is one requiring patience. It has little in common with a portfolio of high-flying glamour stocks and during periods of popularity for the latter, we may appear quite stodgy.

It is to our advantage to have securities do nothing price wise for months, or perhaps years, why we are buying them. This points up the need to measure our results over an adequate period of time. We suggest three years as a minimum.

(2) We cannot talk about our current investment operations. Such an open-mouth policy could never improve our results and in some situations could seriously hurt us. For this reason, should anyone, including partners, ask us whether we are interested in any security, we must plead the “5th Amendment.”

#### First Half Performance

The whole family is leaving for California on June 23rd so I am fudging a bit on this report and writing it June 18th. However, for those of you who set your watches by the receipt of our letters. I will maintain our usual chronological symmetry in reporting, leaving a few blanks which Bill will fill in after the final June 30th figures are available.

During the first half of 1964 the Dow-Jones Industrial Average (hereinafter called the “DOW”) advanced from 762.95 to 831.50. If one had owned the Dow during this period, dividends of approximately 14.40 would have been received, bringing the overall return from the Dow during the first half to plus 10.0%. As I write this on June 18th, it appears that our results will differ only insignificantly from those of the Dow. I would feel much better reporting to you that the Dow had broken even, and we had been plus 5%, or better still, that the Dow had been minus 10%, and we had broken even. I have always pointed out, however, that gaining an edge on the Dow is more difficult for us in advancing markets than in static or declining ones.

To bring the record up to date, the following summarizes the performance of the Dow, the performance of the Partnership before allocation to the general partner and the limited partners' results:

| 年份（Year） | 道琼斯总体业绩（1）（Overall Results From Dow (1)） | 合伙业绩（2）（Partnership Results (2)） | 有限合伙人业绩（3）（Limited Partners’ Results (3)） |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1957年 | -8.4% | 10.4% | 9.3% |
| 1958年 | 38.5% | 40.9% | 32.2% |
| 1959年 | 20.0% | 25.9% | 20.9% |
| 1960年 | -6.2% | 22.8% | 18.6% |
| 1961年 | 22.4% | 45.9% | 35.9% |
| 1962年 | -7.6% | 13.9% | 11.9% |
| 1963年 | 20.6% | 38.7% | 30.5% |
| 1964年上半年 | 10.9% | 12.0% | 10.5% |
| 累计业绩（Cumulative results） | 116.1% | 521.0% | 354.4% |
| 年复合收益率（Annual compounded rate） | 10.8% | 27.6% | 22.2% | 

(See next page for footnotes to table.)

**Footnotes to preceding table:**

(1) Based on yearly changes in the value of the Dow plus dividends that would have been received through ownership of the Dow during that year. The table includes all complete years of partnership activity.
(2) For 1957-61 consists of combined results of all predecessor limited partnerships operating throughout the entire year after all expenses but before distributions to partners or allocations to the general partner.
(3) For 1957-61 computed on the basis of the preceding column of partnership results allowing forallocation to the general partner based up on the present partnership agreement, but before monthly withdrawals by limited partners.

Buying activities during the first half were quite satisfactory. This is of particular satisfaction to me since I consider the buying end to be about 90% of this business. Our General category now includes three companies where B.P.L. is the largest single stockholder. These stocks have been bought and are continuing to be bought at prices considerably below their value to a private owner. We have been buying one of these situations for approximately eighteen months and both of the others for about a year. It would not surprise me if we continue to do nothing but patiently buy these securities week after week for at least another year, and perhaps even two years or more.

What we really like to see in situations like the three mentioned above is a condition where the company is making substantial progress in terms of improving earnings, increasing asset values, etc., but where the market price of the stock is doing very little while we continue to acquire it. This doesn't do much for our short-term performance, particularly relative to a rising market, but it is a comfortable and logical producer of longer-term profits. Such activity should usually result in either appreciation of market prices from external factors or the acquisition by us of a controlling position in a business at a bargain price. Either alternative suits me.

It is important to realize, however, that most of our holdings in the General category continue to be securities which we believe to be considerably undervalued, but where there is not the slightest possibility that we could have a controlling position. We expect the market to justify our analyses of such situations in a reasonable period of time, but we do not have the two strings to our bow mentioned in the above paragraph working for us in these securities.

_Investment Companies_

We regularly compare our results with the two largest open-end investment companies (mutual funds) that follow a policy of being typically 95%-100% invested in common stocks, and the two largest diversified closed-end investment companies. These four companies, Massachusetts Investors Trust, Investors Stock Fund, Tri-Continental Corp., and Lehman Corp., manage over $4 billion and are probably typical of most of the $28 billion investment company industry. Their results are shown below. My opinion is that this performance roughly parallels that of the overwhelming majority of other investment advisory organizations which handle, in aggregate, vastly greater sums.

(1) Computed from changes in asset value plus any distributions to holders of record during year.

These figures continue to show that the most highly paid and respected investment management has difficulty matching the performance of an unmanaged index of blue chip stocks. The results of these companies in some ways resemble the activity of a duck sitting on a pond. When the water (the market) rises, the duck rises; when it falls, back goes the duck. SPCA or no SPCA, I think the duck can only take the credit (or blame) for his own activities. The rise and fall of the lake is hardly something for him to quack about. The water level has been of great importance to B.P.L’s performance as the table on page one indicates. However, we have also occasionally flapped our wings.

I would like to emphasize that I am not saying that the Dow is the only way of measuring investment performance in common stocks. However, I do say that all investment managements (including selfmanagement) should be subjected to objective tests, and that the standards should be selected a priori rather than conveniently chosen retrospectively.

The management of money is big business. Investment managers place great stress on evaluating company managements in the auto industry, steel industry, chemical industry, etc. These evaluations take enormous amounts of work, are usually delivered with great solemnity, and are devoted to finding out which companies are well managed and which companies have management weaknesses. After devoting strenuous efforts to objectively measuring the managements of portfolio companies, it seems strange indeed that similar examination is not applied to the portfolio managers themselves. We feel it is essential that investors and investment managements establish standards of performance and, regularly and objectively, study their own results just as carefully as they study their investments.

We will regularly follow this policy wherever it may lead. It is perhaps too obvious to say that our policy of measuring performance in no way guarantees good results--it merely guarantees objective evaluation. I want to stress the points mentioned in the "Ground Rules" regarding application of the standard--namely that it should be applied on at least a three-year basis because of the nature of our operation and also that during a speculative boom we may lag the field. However, one thing I can promise you. We started out with a 36-inch yardstick and we'll keep it that way. If we don't measure up, we won't change yardsticks. In my opinion, the entire field of investment management, involving hundreds of billions of dollars, would be more satisfactorily conducted if everyone had a good yardstick for measurement of ability and sensibly applied it. This is regularly done by most people in the conduct of their own business when evaluating markets, people, machines, methods, etc., and money management is the largest business in the world.

Taxes

We entered 1964 with net unrealized gains of $2,991,090 which is all attributable to partners belonging during 1963. Through June 30th we have realized capital gains of $2,826,248.76 (of which 96% are long term) so it appears very likely that at least all the unrealized appreciation attributable to your interest and reported to you in our letter of January 25, 1964, (item 3) will be realized this year. I again want to emphasize that this has nothing to do with how we are doing. It is possible that I could have made the above statement, and the market value of your B.P.L. interest could have shrunk substantially since January 1st, so the fact that we have large realized gains is no cause for exultation. Similarly when our realized gains are very small there is not necessarily any reason to be discouraged. We do not play any games to either accelerate or defer taxes. We make investment decisions based on our evaluation of the most profitable combination of probabilities. If this means paying taxes I'm glad the rates on long-term capital gains are as low as they are.As previously stated in our most recent tax letter of April 1, 1964 the safe course to follow on interim estimates is to pay the same estimated tax for 1964 as your actual tax was for 1963. There can be no penalties if you follow this procedure.

The tax liability for partners who entered January 1st will, of course, be quite moderate, as it always is in the first year for any partner. This occurs because realized capital gains are first attributed to old partners having an interest in unrealized appreciation. This, again, of course, has nothing to do with economic performance. All limited partners, new and old, (except for Bill Scott, Ruth Scott and Susan Buffett per paragraph five of the Partnership Agreement) end up with exactly the same results. As usual, net ordinary income for all partners is nominal to date.

As in past years, we will have a letter out about November 1st (to partners and those who have indicated an interest, to us by that time in becoming partners) with the amendment to the Partnership Agreement, Commitment Letter for 1965, estimate or the 1964 tax situation, etc. In the meantime, keep Bill busy this summer clearing up anything in this letter that comes out fuzzy.

Cordially, 

Warren E. Buffett

#### Our Performance in 1964

Although we had an overall gain of $4,846,312.37 in 1964, it was not one of our better years as judged by our fundamental yardstick, the Dow-Jones Industrial Average (hereinafter called the "Dow"). The overall result for BPL was plus 27.8% compared to an overall plus 18.7% for the Dow. The overall result for limited partners was plus 22.3%. Both the advantage of 9.1 percentage points on a partnership basis and 3.6 points by the limited partners were the poorest since 1959, which was a year of roughly comparable gains for the Dow.

Nevertheless, I am not depressed. It was a strong year for the general market, and it is always tougher for us to outshine the Dow in such a year. We are certain to have years when the Dow gives us a drubbing and, in some respects, I feel rather fortunate that 1964 wasn't the year. Because of the problems that galloping markets pose for us, a Dow repeat in 1965 of 1964 results would make it most difficult for us to match its performance, let alone surpass it by a decent margin.

To bring the record up to date, the following summarizes the year-by-year performance of the Dow, the performance of the Partnership before allocation to the general partner, and the limited partner's results:

| 年份（Year） | 道琼斯总体业绩（1）（Overall Results From Dow (1)） | 合伙业绩（2）（Partnership Results (2)） | 有限合伙人业绩（3）（Limited Partners’ Results (3)） |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| 1960年 | -6.2% | 22.8% | 18.6% |
| 1961年 | 22.4% | 45.9% | 35.9% |
| 1962年 | -7.6% | 13.9% | 11.9% |
| 1963年 | 20.6% | 38.7% | 30.5% |
| 1964年 | 18.7% | 27.8% | 22.3% | 

(1) Based on yearly changes in the value of the Dow plus dividends that would have been received through ownership of the Dow during that year. The table includes all complete years of partnership activity.

(2) For 1957-61 consists of combined results of all predecessor limited partnerships operating throughout the entire year after all expenses, but before distributions to partners or allocations to the general partner.

(3) For 1957-61 computed on the basis of the preceding column of partnership results allowing for allocation to the general partner based upon the present partnership agreement, but before monthly withdrawals by limited partners.

On a cumulative or compounded basis, the results are:

|年份（Year）|道琼斯总体业绩（Overall Results From Dow）|合伙业绩（Partnership Results）|有限合伙人业绩（Limited Partners’ Results）|
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1957年 | -8.4% | 10.4% | 9.3% |
| 1957 - 1958年 | 26.9% | 55.6% | 44.5% |
| 1957 - 1959年 | 52.3% | 95.9% | 74.7% |
| 1957 - 1960年 | 42.9% | 140.9% | 107.2% |
| 1957 - 1961年 | 74.9% | 251.0% | 181.6% |
| 1957 - 1962年 | 61.6% | 299.8% | 215.1% |
| 1957 - 1963年 | 94.9% | 454.5% | 311.2% |
| 1957 - 1964年 | 131.3%| 608.7% | 402.9% |
| 年复合收益率（Annual Compounded Rate） | 11.1% | 27.7% | 22.3% |

_Investment Companies_

We regularly compare our results with the two largest open-end investment companies (mutual funds) that follow a policy of being typically 95-100% invested in common stock, and the two largest diversified closedend investment companies. These four companies, Massachusetts Investors Trust, Investors Stock Fund, TriContinental Corporation, and Lehman Corporation, manage about $4.5 billion, are owned by about 550,000 shareholders, and are probably typical of most of the $30 billion investment company industry. My opinion is that their results roughly parallel those of the overwhelming majority of other investment advisory organizations which handle, in aggregate, vastly greater sums.

The purpose of this tabulation, which is shown below, is to illustrate that the Dow is no pushover as an index of investment achievement. The advisory talent managing just the four companies shown commands annual fees of over $8 million and this represents a very small fraction of the professional investment management industry. The public batting average of this highly-paid and widely respected talent indicates performance a shade below that of the Dow, an unmanaged index.

The repetition of these tables has caused partners to ask: "Why in the world does this happen to very intelligent managements working with (1) bright, energetic staff people, (2) virtually unlimited resources, (3) the most extensive business contacts, and (4) literally centuries of aggregate investment experience?" (The latter qualification brings to mind the fellow who applied for a job and stated he had twenty years of experience -which was corrected by the former employer to read “one year's experience -twenty times.”) 

This question is of enormous importance, and you would expect it to be the subject of considerable study by investment managers and substantial investors. After all, each percentage point on $30 billion is $300 million per year. Curiously enough, there is practically nothing in the literature of Wall Street attracting this problem, and discussion of it is virtually absent at security analyst society meetings, conventions, seminars, etc. My opinion is that the first job of any investment management organization is to analyze its own techniques and results before pronouncing judgment on the managerial abilities and performance of the major corporate entities of the United States.

In the great majority of cases the lack of performance exceeding or even matching an unmanaged index in no way reflects lack of either intellectual capacity or integrity. I think it is much more the product of: (1) group decisions - my perhaps jaundiced view is that it is close to impossible for outstanding investment management to come from a group of any size with all parties really participating in decisions; (2) a desire to conform to the policies and (to an extent) the portfolios of other large well-regarded organizations; (3) an institutional framework whereby average is "safe" and the personal rewards for independent action are in no way commensurate with the general risk attached to such action; (4) an adherence to certain diversification practices which are irrational; and finally and importantly, (5) inertia. 

Perhaps the above comments are unjust. Perhaps even our statistical comparisons are unjust. Both our portfolio and method of operation differ substantially from the investment companies in the table. However, I believe both our partners and their stockholders feel their managements are seeking the same goal - the maximum longterm average return on capital obtainable with the minimum risk of permanent loss consistent with a program of continuous investment in equities. Since we should have common goals, and most partners, as an alternative to their interest in BPL, would probably have their funds invested in media producing results comparable with these investment companies, I feel their performance record is meaningful in judging our own results.

There is no question that an important service is provided to investors by investment companies, investment advisors, trust departments, etc. This service revolves around the attainment of adequate diversification, the preservation of a long-term outlook, the ease of handling investment decisions and mechanics, and most importantly, the avoidance of the patently inferior investment techniques which seem to entice some individuals. All but a few of the organizations do not specifically promise to deliver superior investment performance although it is perhaps not unreasonable for the public to draw such an inference from their advertised emphasis on professional management.

One thing I pledge to you as partners - just as I consider the previously stated performance comparison to be meaningful now, so will I in future years, no, matter what tale unfolds. Correspondingly, I ask that you, if you do not feel such a standard to be relevant, register such disagreement now and suggest other standards which can be applied prospectively rather than retrospectively.

One additional thought - I have not included a column in my table for the most widely-used investment advisor in the world - Bell management. People who watch their weight, golf scores, and fuel bills seem to shun quantitative evaluation of their investment management skills although it involves the most important client in the world - themselves. While it may be of academic interest to evaluate the management accomplishments of Massachusetts Investors Trust or Lehman Corporation, it is of enormous dollars-and-cents importance to evaluate objectively the accomplishments of the fellow who is actually handling your money - even if it’s you.

**The Question of Conservatism**

In looking at the table of investment company performance, the question might be asked: “Yes, but aren't those companies run more conservatively than the Partnership?" If you asked that question of the investment company managements, they, in absolute honesty, would say they were more conservative. If you asked the first hundred security analysts you met, I am sure that a very large majority of them also would answer for the investment companies. I would disagree. I have over 90% of my net worth in BPL, and most of my family have percentages in that area, but of course, that only demonstrates the sincerity of my view - not the validity of it.

It is unquestionably true that the investment companies have their money more conventionally invested than we do. To many people conventionality is indistinguishable from conservatism. In my view, this represents erroneous thinking. Neither a conventional nor an unconventional approach, per se, is conservative.

Truly conservative actions arise from intelligent hypotheses, correct facts and sound reasoning. These qualities may lead to conventional acts, but there have been many times when they have led to unorthodoxy. In some corner of the world they are probably still holding regular meetings of the Flat Earth Society.

We derive no comfort because important people, vocal people, or great numbers of people agree with us. Nor do we derive comfort if they don't. A public opinion poll is no substitute for thought. When we really sit back with a smile on our face is when we run into a situation we can understand, where the facts are ascertainable and clear, and the course of action obvious. In that case - whether other conventional or unconventional - whether others agree or disagree - we feel - we are progressing in a conservative manner.

The above may seem highly subjective. It is. You should prefer an objective approach to the question. I do. My suggestion as to one rational way to evaluate the conservativeness of past policies is to study performance in declining markets. We have only three years of declining markets in our table and unfortunately (for purposes of this test only) they were all moderate declines. In all three of these years we achieved appreciably better investment results than any of the more conventional portfolios.

Specifically, if those three years had occurred in sequence, the cumulative results would have been: 

| Tri-Continental Corp. | -9.7% |
| Dow | -20.6% |
| Mass. Investors Trust | -20.9% |
| Lehman Corp. | -22.3% |
| Investors Stock Fund | -24.6% |
| Limited Partners | +45.0% |

We don’t think this comparison is all important, but we do think it has some relevance. We certainly think it makes more sense than saying “We own (regardless of price) A.T. &T., General Electric, IBM and General Motors and are therefore conservative.” In any event, evaluation of the conservatism of any investment program or management (including self-management) should be based upon rational objective standards, and I suggest performance in declining markets to be at least one meaningful test.

**The Joys of Compounding**

Readers of our early annual letters registered discontent at a mere recital of contemporary investment experience, but instead hungered for the intellectual stimulation that only could be provided by a depth study of investment strategy spanning the centuries. Hence, this section.

Our last two excursions into the mythology of financial expertise have revealed that purportedly shrewd investments by Isabella (backing the voyage of Columbus) and Francis I (original purchase of Mona Lisa) bordered on fiscal lunacy. Apologists for these parties have presented an array of sentimental trivia. Through it all, our compounding tables have not been dented by attack.

Nevertheless, one criticism has stung a bit. The charge has been made that this column has acquired a negative tone with only the financial incompetents of history receiving comment. We have been challenged to record on these pages a story of financial perspicacity which will be a bench mark of brilliance down through the ages.

One story stands out. This, of course, is the saga of trading acumen etched into history by the Manhattan Indians when they unloaded their island to that notorious spendthrift, Peter Minuit in 1626. My understanding is that they received $24 net. For this, Minuit received 22.3 square miles which works out to about 621,688,320 square feet. While on the basis of comparable sales, it is difficult to arrive at a precise appraisal, a $20 per square foot estimate seems reasonable giving a current land value for the island of $12,433,766,400 ($12 1/2 billion). To the novice, perhaps this sounds like a decent deal. However, the Indians have only had to achieve a 6 1/2% return (The tribal mutual fund representative would have promised them this.) to obtain the last laugh on Minuit. At 6 1/2%, $24 becomes $42,105,772,800 ($42 billion) in 338 years, and if they just managed to squeeze out an extra half point to get to 7%, the present value becomes $205 billion.

So much for that.

Some of you may view your investment policies on a shorter term basis. For your convenience, we include our usual table indicating the gains from compounding $100,000 at various rates:

| 4% | 8% | 12% | 16% |
| 10 | Years | $48,024 | $115,892 | $210,584 | $341,143 |
| 20 | Years | $119,111 | $366,094 | $864,627 | $1,846,060 |
| 30 | Years | $224,337 | $906,260 | $2,895,970 | $8,484,940 |

This table indicates the financial advantages of:

(1) A long life (in the erudite vocabulary of the financial sophisticate this is referred to as the Methusalah Technique)

(2) A high compound rate

(3) A combination of both (especially recommended by this author)

To be observed are the enormous benefits produced by relatively small gains in the annual earnings rate. This explains our attitude which while hopeful of achieving a striking margin of superiority over average investment results, nevertheless, regards every percentage point of investment return above average as having real meaning.

**Our Goal**

You will note that there are no columns in the preceding table for the 27.7% average of the Partnership during its eight-year lifespan or the 22.3% average of the limited partners. Such figures are nonsensical for the long term for several reasons: (Don't worry about me "holding back" to substantiate this prophecy.)

(1) Any significant sums compounded at such rates take on national debt proportions at alarming speed.

(2) During our eight-year history a general revaluation of securities has produced average annual rates of overall gain from the whole common stock field which I believe unattainable in future decades. Over a span of 20 or 30 years, I would expect something more like 6% - 7% overall annual gain from the Dow instead of the 11.1% during our brief history. This factor alone would tend to knock 4 points or so off of our annual compounding rate. It would only take a minus 20.5% year in 1965 for the Dow to bring it down to a 7% average figure for the nine years. Such years (or worse) should definitely be expected from time to time by those holding equity investments. If a 20% or 30% drop in the market value of your equity holdings (such as BPL) is going to produce emotional or financial distress, you should simply avoid common stock type investments. In the words of the poet - Harry Truman – “If you can’t stand the heat, stay out of the kitchen. It is preferable, of course, to consider the problem before you enter the “kitchen.”

(3) We do not consider it possible on an extended basis to maintain the 16.6 percentage point advantage over the Dow of the Partnership or the 11.2 percentage point edge enjoyed by the limited partners. We have had eight consecutive years in which our pool of money has out-performed the Dow, although the profit allocation arrangement left the limited partners short of Dow results in one of those years. We are certain to have years (note the plural) when the Partnership results fall short of the Dow despite considerable gnashing of teeth by the general partner (I hope not too much by the limited partners). When that happens our average margin of superiority will drop sharply. I might say that I also think we will continue to have some years of very decent margins in our favor. However, to date we have benefited by the fact that we have not had a really mediocre (or worse) year included in our average, and this obviously cannot be expected to be a permanent experience.

So what can we expect to achieve? Of course, anything I might say is largely guesswork, and my own investment philosophy has developed around the theory that prophecy reveals far more of the frailties of the prophet than it reveals of the future.

Nevertheless, you, as partners, are entitled to know my expectations, tenuous as they may be. I am hopeful that our longer term experience will unfold along the following basis:

(1) An overall gain from the Dow (including dividends, of course) averaging in the area of 7% per annum, exhibiting customarily wide amplitudes in achieving this average -- say, on the order or minus 40% to plus 50% at the extremes with the majority of years in the minus 10% to plus 20% range;
(2) An average advantage of ten percentage points per annum for BPL before allocation to the general partner - again with large amplitudes in the margin from perhaps 10 percentage points worse than the Dow in a bad year to 25 percentage points better when everything clicks; and
(3) The product of these two assumptions gives an average of 17% to BPL or about 14% to limited partners. This figure would vary enormously from year to year; the final amplitudes, of course, depending, on the interplay of the extremes hypothesized in (1) and (2).

I would like to emphasize that the above is conjecture, perhaps heavily influenced by self-interest, ego, etc. Anyone with a sense of financial history knows this sort of guesswork is subject to enormous error. It might better be left out of this letter, but it is a question frequently and legitimately asked by partners. Long-rangeexpectable return is the primary consideration of all of us belonging to BPL, and it is reasonable that I should be put on record, foolish as that may later make me appear. My rather puritanical view is that any investment manager, whether operating as broker, investment counselor, trust department, Investment Company, etc., should be willing to state unequivocally what he is going to attempt to accomplish and how he proposes to measure the extent to which he gets the job done.

**Our Method of Operation**

In past annual letters I have always utilized three categories to describe investment operations we conduct. I now feel that a four-category division is more appropriate. Partially, the addition of a new section - "Generals Relatively Undervalued" - reflects my further consideration of essential differences that have always existed to a small extent with our "Generals" group. Partially, it reflects the growing importance of what once was a very small sub-category but is now a much more significant part of our total portfolio. This increasing importance has been accompanied by excellent results to date justifying significant time and effort devoted to finding additional opportunities in this area. Finally, it partially reflects the development and implementation of a new and somewhat unique investment technique designed to improve the expectancy and consistency of operations in this category. Therefore, our four present categories are: 

1. “Generals -Private Owner Basis” - a category of generally undervalued stocks, determined by quantitative standards, but with considerable attention also paid to the qualitative factor. There is often little or nothing to indicate immediate market improvement. The issues lack glamour or market sponsorship. Their main qualification is a bargain price; that is, an overall valuation of the enterprise substantially below what careful analysis indicates its value to a private owner to be. Again, let me emphasize that while the quantitative comes first and is essential, the qualitative is important. We like good management - we like a decent industry - we like a certain amount of “ferment” in a previously dormant management or stockholder group. But, we demand value.
Many times in this category we have the desirable "two strings to our bow" situation where we should either achieve appreciation of market prices from external factors or from the acquisition of a controlling position in a business at a bargain price. While the former happens in the overwhelming majority of cases, the latter represents an insurance policy most investment operations don't have. We have continued to enlarge the positions in the three companies described in our 1964 midyear report where we are the largest stockholder. All three companies are increasing their fundamental value at a very satisfactory rate, and we are completely passive in two situations and active only on a very minor scale in the third. It is unlikely that we will ever take a really active part in policy-making in any of these three companies, but we stand ready if needed.
2. "Generals -Relatively Undervalued" - this category consists of securities selling at prices relatively cheap compared to securities of the same general quality. We demand substantial discrepancies from current valuation standards, but (usually because of large size) do not feel value to a private owner to be a meaningful concept. It is important in this category, of course, that apples be compared to apples - and not to oranges, and we work hard at achieving that end. In the great majority of cases we simply do not know enough about the industry or company to come to sensible judgments -in that situation we pass.
As mentioned earlier, this new category has been growing and has produced very satisfactory results. We have recently begun to implement a technique, which gives promise of very substantially reducing the risk from an overall change in valuation standards; e.g. I we buy something at 12 times earnings when comparable or poorer quality companies sell at 20 times earnings, but then a major revaluation takes place so the latter only sell at 10 times.
This risk has always bothered us enormously because of the helpless position in which we could be left compared to the "Generals -Private Owner" or "Workouts" types. With this risk diminished, we think this category has a promising future.

3. "Workouts" - these are the securities with a timetable. They arise from corporate activity - sell-outs, mergers, reorganizations, spin-offs, etc. In this category we are not talking about rumors or "inside information" pertaining to such developments, but to publicly announced activities of this sort. We wait until we can read it in the paper. The risk pertains not primarily to general market behavior (although that is sometimes tied in to a degree), but instead to something upsetting the applecart so that the expected development does not materialize. Such killjoys could include anti-trust or other negative government action, stockholder disapproval, withholding of tax rulings, etc. The gross profits in many workouts appear quite small. It's a little like looking for parking meters with some time left on them. However, the predictability coupled with a short holding period produces quite decent average annual rates of return after allowance for the occasional substantial loss. This category produces more steady absolute profits from year to year than generals do. In years of market decline it should usually pile up a big edge for us; during bull markets it will probably be a drag on performance. On a long-term basis, I expect the workouts to achieve the same sort of margin over the Dow attained by generals.

4. "Controls" - these are rarities, but when they occur they are likely to be of significant size. Unless we start off with the purchase of a sizable block of stock, controls develop from the general - private owner category. They result from situations where a cheap security does nothing pricewise for such an extended period of time that we are able to buy a significant percentage of the company's stock. At that point we are probably in a position to assume a degree of or perhaps complete control of the company's activities. Whether we become active or remain relatively passive at this point depends upon our assessment of the company's future and the managements capabilities. 

We do not want to get active merely for the sake of being active. Everything else being equal, I would much rather let others do the work. However, when an active role is necessary to optimize the employment of capital, you can be sure we will not be standing in the wings. 

Active or passive, in a control situation there should be a built-in profit. The sine qua non of this operation is an attractive purchase price. Once control is achieved, the value of our investment is determined by the value of the enterprise, not the oftentimes irrationalities of the market place. 

Any of the three situations where we are now the largest stockholders mentioned under Generals - Private Owner could, by virtue of the two-way stretch they possess, turn into controls. That would suit us fine, but it also suits us if they advance in the market to a price more in line with intrinsic value enabling us to sell them, thereby completing a successful generals - private owner operation.

Investment results in the control category have to be measured on the basis of at least several years. Proper buying takes time. If needed, strengthening management, redirecting the utilization of capital, perhaps effecting a satisfactory sale or merger, etc., are also all factors that make this a business to be measured in years rather than months. For this reason, in controls, we are looking for wide margins of profit -if it appears at all close, we quitclaim.

Controls in the buying stage move largely in sympathy with the Dow. In the later stages their behavior is geared more to that of workouts. 

You might be interested to know that the buyers of our former control situation, Dempster Mill Manufacturing, seem to be doing very well with it. This fulfills our expectation and is a source of satisfaction. An investment operation that depends on the ultimate buyer making a bum deal (in Wall Street they call this the "Bigger Fool Theory") is tenuous indeed. How much more satisfactory it is to buy at really bargain prices so that only an average disposition brings pleasant results.

As I have mentioned in the past, the division of our portfolio among categories is largely determined by the accident of availability. Therefore, in any given year the mix between generals, workouts, or controls is largely a matter of chance, and this fickle factor will have a great deal to do with our performance relative to the Dow. This is one of many reasons why single year's performance is of minor importance and good or bad, should never be taken too seriously.

To give an example of just how important the accident of division between these categories is, let me cite the example of the past three years. Using an entirely different method of calculation than that used to measure the performance of BPL in entirety, whereby the average monthly investment at market value by category is utilized, borrowed money and office operating expenses excluded, etc., (this gives the most accurate basis for intergroup comparisons but does not reflect overall BPL results) the generals (both present categories combined), workouts, and the Dow, shape up as follows: 

| Year | Generals | Workouts | Dow |
| 1962 | -1.0% | 14.6% | -8.6% |
| 1963 | 20.5% | 30.6% | 18.4% |
| 1964 | 27.8% | 10.3% | 16.7% |

Obviously the workouts (along with controls) saved the day in 1962, and if we had been light in this category that year, our final result would have been much poorer, although still quite respectable considering market conditions during the year. We could just as well have had a much smaller percentage of our portfolio in workouts that year; availability decided it, not any notion on my part as to what the market was going to do. Therefore, it is important to realize that in 1962 we were just plain lucky regarding mix of categories.

In 1963 we had one sensational workout which greatly influenced results, and generals gave a good account of themselves, resulting in a banner year. If workouts had been normal, (say, more like 1962) we would have looked much poorer compared to the Dow. Here it wasn't our mix that did much for us, but rather excellent situations.

Finally, in 1964 workouts were a big drag on performance. This would be normal in any event during a big plus year for the Dow such as 1964, but they were even a greater drag than expected because of mediocre experience. In retrospect it would have been pleasant to have been entirely in generals, but we don’t play the game in retrospect.

I hope the preceding table drives home the point that results in a given year are subject to many variables - some regarding which we have little control or insight. We consider all categories to be good businesses and we are very happy we have several to rely on rather than just one. It makes for more discrimination within each category and reduces the chance we will be put completely out of operation by the elimination of opportunities in a single category.

**Taxes**

We have had a chorus of groans this year regarding partners' tax liabilities. Of course, we also might have had a few if the tax sheet had gone out blank.

More investment sins are probably committed by otherwise quite intelligent people because of "tax considerations" than from any other cause. One of my friends - a noted West Coast philosopher maintains that a majority of life's errors are caused by forgetting what one is really trying to do. This is certainly the case when an emotionally supercharged element like taxes enters the picture (I have another friend -a noted East Coast philosopher who says it isn't the lack of representation he minds -it's the taxation).

Let's get back to the West Coast. What is one really trying to do in the investment world? Not pay the least taxes, although that may be a factor to be considered in achieving the end. Means and end should not be confused, however, and the end is to come away with the largest after-tax rate of compound. Quite obviously if two courses of action promise equal rates of pre-tax compound and one involves incurring taxes and the other doesn't the latter course is superior. However, we find this is rarely the case.

It is extremely improbable that 20 stocks selected from, say, 3000 choices are going to prove to be the optimum portfolio both now and a year from now at the entirely different prices (both for the selections and the alternatives) prevailing at that later date. If our objective is to produce the maximum after-tax compound rate, we simply have to own the most attractive securities obtainable at current prices, And, with 3,000 rather rapidly shifting variables, this must mean change (hopefully “tax-generating” change).

It is obvious that the performance of a stock last year or last month is no reason, per se, to either own it or to not own it now. It is obvious that an inability to "get even" in a security that has declined is of no importance. It is obvious that the inner warm glow that results from having held a winner last year is of no importance in making a decision as to whether it belongs in an optimum portfolio this year.

If gains are involved, changing portfolios involves paying taxes. Except in very unusual cases (I will readily admit there are some cases), the amount of the tax is of minor importance if the difference in expectable performance is significant. I have never been able to understand why the tax comes as such a body blow to many people since the rate on long-term capital gain is lower than on most lines of endeavor (tax policy indicates digging ditches is regarded as socially less desirable than shuffling stock certificates). 

I have a large percentage of pragmatists in the audience so I had better get off that idealistic kick. There are only three ways to avoid ultimately paying the tax: (1) die with the asset - and that's a little too ultimate for me even the zealots would have to view this "cure" with mixed emotions; (2) give the asset away - you certainly don't pay any taxes this way, but of course you don't pay for any groceries, rent, etc., either; and (3) lose back the gain if your mouth waters at this tax-saver, I have to admire you -you certainly have the courage of your convictions.

So it is going to continue to be the policy of BPL to try to maximize investment gains, not minimize taxes. We will do our level best to create the maximum revenue for the Treasury -at the lowest rates the rules will allow.

An interesting sidelight on this whole business of taxes, vis-à-vis investment management, has appeared in the last few years. This has arisen through the creation of so-called "swap funds" which are investment companies created by the exchange of the investment company's shares for general market securities held by potential investors. The dominant sales argument has been the deferment (deferment, when pronounced by an enthusiastic salesman, sometimes comes very close phonetically to elimination) of capital gains taxes while trading a single security for a diversified portfolio. The tax will only finally be paid when the swap fund's shares are redeemed. For the lucky ones, it will be avoided entirely when any of those delightful alternatives mentioned two paragraphs earlier eventuates.

The reasoning implicit in the swapee's action is rather interesting. He obviously doesn't really want to hold what he is holding or he wouldn't jump at the chance to swap it (and pay a fairly healthy commission - usually up to $100,000) for a grab-bag of similar hot potatoes held by other tax-numbed investors. In all fairness, I should point out that after all offerees have submitted their securities for exchange and had a chance to review the proposed portfolio they have a chance to back out but I understand a relatively small proportion do so.

There have been twelve such funds (that I know of) established since origination of the idea in 1960, and several more are currently in the works. The idea is not without appeal since sales totaled well over $600 million. All of the funds retain an investment manager to whom they usually pay 1/2 of 1% of asset value. This investment manager faces an interesting problem; he is paid to manage the fund intelligently (in each of the five largest funds this fee currently ranges from $250,000 to $700,000 per year), but because of the low tax basis inherited from the contributors of securities, virtually his every move creates capital gains tax liabilities. And, of course, he knows that if he incurs such liabilities, he is doing so for people who are probably quite sensitive to taxes or they wouldn't own shares in the swap fund in the first place.

I am putting all of this a bit strongly, and I am sure there are some cases where a swap fund may be the best answer to an individual's combined tax and investment problems. Nevertheless, I feel they offer a very interesting test-tube to measure the ability of some of the most respected investment advisors when they are trying to manage money without paying (significant) taxes.

The three largest swap funds were all organized in 1961, and combined have assets now of about $300 million. One of these, Diversification Fund, reports on a fiscal year basis which makes extraction of relevant data quite difficult for calendar year comparisons. The other two, Federal Street Fund and Westminster Fund (respectively first and third largest in the group) are managed by investment advisors who oversee at least $2 billion of institutional money.

Here's how they shape up for all full years of existence:

|年份（Year）|联邦街（Federal Street）|威斯敏斯特（Westminster）|道琼斯（Dow）|
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
|1962年| -19.0%| -22.5%| -7.6%|
|1963年| 17.0%| 18.7%| 20.6%|
|1964年| 13.8%| 12.3%| 18.7%|
|年复合收益率（Annual Compounded Rate）| 2.6%| 1.1%| 9.8%| 

This is strictly the management record. No allowance has been made for the commission in entering and any taxes paid by the fund on behalf of the shareholders have been added back to performance.

Anyone for taxes?

**Miscellaneous**

In the December 21st issue of AUTOMOTIVE NEWS it was reported that Ford Motor Co. plans to spend $700 
million in 1965 to add 6,742,000 square feet to its facilities throughout the world. Buffett Partnership, Ltd., never far behind, plans to add 227 1/4 square feet to its facilities in the spring of 1965.

Our growth in net assets from $105,100 (there's no prize for guessing who put in the $100) on May 5, 1956 when the first predecessor limited partnership.(Buffett Associates, Ltd. ) was organized, to $26,074,000 on 1/1/65 creates the need for an occasional reorganization in internal routine. Therefore, roughly contemporaneously with the bold move from 682 to 909 ¼ square feet, a highly capable is going to join our organization with responsibility for the administrative (and certain other) functions. This move will particularly serve to free up more of Bill Scott's time for security analysis which is his forte. I’ll have more to report on this in the midyear letter.

Bill (who continues to do a terrific job) and his wife have an investment in the Partnership of $298,749, a very large majority of their net worth. Our new associate (his name is being withheld until his present employer has replaced him), along with his wife and children, has made an important investment in the Partnership. Susie and I presently have an interest of $3,406,700 in BPL which represents virtually our entire net worth, with the exception of our continued holding of Mid-Continent Tab Card Co., a local company into which I bought in 1960 when it had less than 10 stockholders. Additionally, my relatives, consisting of three children, mother , two sisters, two brothers-in-law, father-in-Law, four aunts, four cousins and six nieces and nephews, have interests in BPL, directly or indirectly, totaling $1,942,592. So we all continue to eat home cooking.

We continue to represent the ultimate in seasonal businesses --open one day a year. This creates real problems in keeping the paper flowing smoothly, but Beth and Donna continue to do an outstanding job of coping with this and other problems.

Peat, Marwick, Mitchell has distinguished itself in its usual vital role of finding out what belongs to whom. We continue to throw impossible deadlines at them --and they continue to perform magnificently. You will note in their certificate this year that they have implemented the new procedure whereby they now pounce on us unannounced twice a year in addition to the regular yearend effort.

Finally -and most sincerely -let me thank you partners who cooperate magnificently in getting things to us promptly and properly and thereby maximize the time we can spend working where we should be -by the cash register. I am extremely fortunate in being able to spend the great majority of my time thinking about where our money should be invested, rather than getting bogged down in the minutiae that seems to overwhelm so many business entities. We have an organizational structure which makes this efficiency a possibility, and more importantly, we have a group of partners that make it a reality. For this, I am most appreciative and we are all wealthier.

Our past policy has been to admit close relatives of present partners without a minimum capital limitation. This year a flood of children, grandchildren, etc., appeared which called this policy into question; therefore, I have decided to institute a $25,000 minimum on interests of immediate relatives of present partners.

Within the coming two weeks you will receive:

(1) A tax letter giving you all BPL information needed for your 1964 federal income tax return. This letter is the only item that counts for tax purposes. 

(2) An audit from Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co. for 1964, setting forth the operations and financial position of BPL as well as your own capital account.

(3) A letter signed by me setting forth the status of your BPL interest on 111165. This is identical with the figure developed in the audit.

(4) Schedule “A” to the partnership agreement listing all partners.

Let Bill or me know if anything needs clarifying. Even with our splendid staff our growth means there is more chance of missing letters, overlooked instructions, a name skipped over, a figure transposition, etc., so speak up if you have any question at all that we might have erred. My next letter will be about July 15th" summarizing the first half of this year.

Cordially,

Warren E. Buffett

**First Half Performance:**

During the first half of 1965, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (hereinafter call the “Dow”) declined from 874.13 to 868.03. This minor change was accomplished in a decidedly non-Euclidian manner. The Dow instead took the scenic route, reaching a high of 939.62 on May 14th. Adding back dividends on the Dow of 13.49 gives an overall gain through ownership of the Dow for the first half of 7.39 or 0.8%.

We had one of our better periods with an overall gain, before allocation to the general partner, of 10.4% or a 9.6 percentage point advantage over the Dow. To bring the record up to date, the following summarizes the year-by-year performance of the Dow, the performance of the Partnership before allocation to the general partner, and the limited partners’ results:

|年份（Year）|道琼斯总体业绩（1）（Overall Results From Dow (1)）|合伙业绩（2）（Partnership Results (2)）|有限合伙人业绩（3）（Limited Partners’ Results (3)）|
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
|1957年| -8.4%|10.4%|9.3%|
|1958年|38.5%|40.9%|32.2%|
|1959年|20.0%|25.9%|20.9%|
|1960年| -6.2%|22.8%|18.6%|
|1961年|22.4%|45.9%|35.9%|
|1962年| -7.6%|13.9%|11.9%|
|1963年|20.6%|38.7%|30.5%|
|1964年|18.7%|27.8%|22.3%|
|1965年上半年|0.8%|10.4%|9.3%|
|累计业绩（Cumulative results）|133.2%|682.4%|449.7%|
|年复合收益率（Annual compounded rate）|10.5%|27.4%|22.2%| 

(1) Based on yearly changes in the value of the Dow plus dividends that would have been received through ownership of the Dow during that year. The table includes all complete years of partnership activity.

(2) For 1957-61 consists of combined results of all predecessor limited partnerships operating throughout the entire year after all expenses but before distributions to partners or allocations to the general partner.

(3) For 1957-61 computed on the basis of the preceding column of partnership results allowing for allocation to the general partner based upon the present partnership agreement, but before monthly withdrawals by limited partners.

Our constant admonitions have been: (1) that short-term results (less than three years) have little meaning, particularly in reference to an investment operation such as ours that may devote a portion of resources to control situations; and, (2) that our results, relative to the Dow and other common-stock-form media usually will be better in declining markets and may well have a difficult time just matching such media in very strong markets.

With the latter point in mind, it might be imagined that we struggled during the first four months of the half to stay even with the Dow and then opened up our margin as it declined in May and June. Just the opposite occurred. We actually achieved a wide margin during the upswing and then fell at a rate fully equal to the Dow during the market decline.

I don’t mention this because I am proud of such performance – on the contrary, I would prefer it if we had achieved our gain in the hypothesized manner. Rather, I mention it for two reasons: (1) you are always entitled to know when I am wrong as well as right; and, (2) it demonstrates that although we deal with probabilities and expectations, the actual results can deviate substantially from such expectations, particularly on a short-term basis. As mentioned in the most recent annual letter, our long-term goal is to achieve a ten percentage point per annum advantage over the Dow. Our advantage of 9.6 points achieved during the first six months must be regarded as substantially above average. The fortitude demonstrated by our partners in tolerating such favorable variations is commendable. We shall most certainly encounter periods when the variations are in the other direction.

During the first half, a series of purchases resulted in the acquisition of a controlling interest in one of the situations described in the “General Private Owner” section of the last annual letter. When such a controlling interest is acquired, the assets and earning power of the business become the immediate predominant factors in value. When a small minority interest in a company is held, earning power and assets are, of course, very important, but they represent an indirect influence on value which, in the short run, may or may not dominate the factors bearing on supply and demand which result in price.

When a controlling interest is held, we own a business rather then a stock, and a business valuation is appropriate. We have carried our controlling position at a conservative valuation at midyear and will reevaluate it in terms of assets and earning power at yearend. The annual letter, issued in January, 1966, will carry a full story on this current control situation. At this time it is enough to say that we are delighted with both the acquisition cost and the business operation, and even happier about the people we have managing the business.

**Investment Companies:**

We regularly compare our results with the two largest open-end investment companies (mutual funds) that follow a policy of being, typically, 95-100% invested in common stocks, and the two largest diversified closed-end investment companies. These four companies, Massachusetts Investors Trust, Investors Stock Fund, Tri-Continental Corp., and Lehman Corp., manage over $4 billion and are probably typical of most of the $30 billion investment company industry. Their results are shown in the following table. My opinion is that this performance roughly parallels that of the overwhelming majority of other investment advisory organizations which handle, in aggregate, vastly greater sums.

|年份（Year）|麻省投资信托（1）（Mass. Inv. Trust (1)）|投资者股票（1）（Investors Stock (1)）|雷曼（2）（Lehman (2)）|三元控股（2）（Tri - Cont. (2)）|道琼斯（Dow）|有限合伙人（Limited Partners）|

|1964年| 15.9%| 14.3%| 14.0%| 13.6%| 18.7%| 22.3%|

|年复合收益率（Annual Compounded Rate）| 9.4%| 8.7%| 9.2%| 9.5%| 10.5%| 22.2%| 

(1) Computed from changes in asset value plus any distributions to holders of record during year.

(2) From 1965 Moody’s Bank & Finance Manual for 1957-64. Estimated for first half 1965.

Last year I mentioned that the performance of these companies in some ways resembles the activity of a duck sitting on a pond. When the water (the market) rises, the duck rises; when if falls, back goes the duck. The water level was virtually unchanged during the first half of 1965. The ducks, as you can see from the table, are still sitting on the pond.

As I mentioned earlier in the letter, the ebb of the tide in May and June also substantially affected us. Nevertheless, the fact we had flapped our wings a few times in the preceding four months enabled us to gain a little altitude on the rest of the flock. Utilizing a somewhat more restrained lexicon, James H. Lorie, director of the University of Chicago’s Center for Research in Security Prices was quoted in the May 25, 1965, WALL STREET JOURNAL as saying: “There is no evidence that mutual funds select stocks better than by the random method.”

Of course, the beauty of the American economic scene has been that random results have been pretty darned good results. The water level has been rising. In our opinion, the probabilities are that over a long period of time, it will continue to rise, though, certainly not without important interruptions. It will be our policy, however, to endeavor to swim strongly, with or against the tide. If our performance declines to a level you can achieve by floating on your back, we will turn in our suits.

**Advance Payments and Advance Withdrawals:**

We accept advance payments from partners and prospective partners at 6% interest from date of receipt until the end of the year. While there is no obligation to convert such advance payments to a partnership interest at the end of the year, this should be the intent at the time it is paid to us.

Similarly, we allow partners to withdraw up to 20% of their partnership account prior to yearend and charge them 6% from date of withdrawal until yearend when it is charged against their capital account. Again, it is not intended that partners use us like a bank, but that they use the withdrawal right for a truly unexpected need for funds. Predictable needs for funds such as quarterly federal tax payments should be handled by a beginning-of-the-year reduction in capital rather than through advance withdrawals from B.P.L. during the year. The withdrawal privilege is to provide for the unanticipated.

The willingness to borrow (through advance payments) and lend (through advance withdrawals) at the same 6% rate may sound downright “un-Buffettlike”. (You can be sure it doesn’t start my adrenaline flowing.) Certainly such a no-spread arbitrage is devoid of the commercial overtones an observer might impute to the preponderance of our transactions. Nevertheless, we think it makes sense and is in the best interest of all partners.

The partner who has a large investment in indirect ownership of a group of liquid assets should have some liquidity present in his partnership interest other than at yearend. As a practical matter, we are reasonably certain that advance withdrawals will be far more than covered by advance payments. For example, on June 30, 1965, we had $98,851 of advance withdrawals and $652,931 of advance payments.

Why then the willingness to pay 6% for the net of advance payments over advance withdrawals when we can borrow from commercial banks at substantially lower rates? The answer is that we expect on a long-term basis to earn better than 6% (the general partner’s allocation is zero unless we do) although it is largely a matter of chance whether we achieve the 6% figure in any short period. Moreover, I can adopt a different attitude regarding the investment of money that can be expected to soon be a part of our equity capital than I can on short-term borrowed money. The advance payments have the added advantage to us of spreading the investment of new money over the year, rather than having it hit us all at once in January. On the other hand, 6% is more than can be obtained in short-term dollar secure investments by our partners, so I consider it mutually profitable.

**Miscellaneous:**

The bold expansion program to 909 ¼ square feet described in the annual letter was carried off without a hitch (the Pepsi’s never even got warm).

John Harding joined us in April and is continuing the record whereby all the actions in the personnel field have been winning ones.

As in past years, we will have a letter out about November 1st (to partners and those who have indicated an interest to me by that time in becoming partners) with the commitment letter for 1966, estimate of the 1965 tax situation, etc.

Cordially,

Warren E. Buffett

November 1, 1965

To My Partners for 1966:

Enclosed are:

(1) Two copies or the commitment letter for 1966, one to be kept by you and one returned to us. You may amend the commitment letter right up to midnight, December 31st. So get it back to us early, and if it needs to be changed, just let us know by letter or phone. Commitment letters become final on December 31st. Every year I get a number or calls in the first week in January expressing a desire to add to the January 1st capital. THIS CAN'T BE DONE.

(2) A copy of our ever-popular "The Ground Rules." It is essential that we see eye-to-eye on the matters covered therein. If you have different views - fine, yours may be better - but you shouldn't be in the partnership. Please particularly note Ground Rule 7. This has been added this year reflecting a moderate shift in my attitude over a period of time. It represents a decidedly unconventional (but logical in myopinion when applied to our operation) approach and is therefore specifically called to your attention.

Any withdrawals will be paid January 5th. You may withdraw any amount you desire from $100 up to your entire equity. Similarly, additions can be for any amount and should reach us by January 10th. In the event you are disposing of anything, this will give you a chance to have the transaction in 1966 if that appears to be advantageous for tax reasons. If additions reach us in November, they take on the status of advance payments and draw 6% interest until yearend. This is not true of additions reaching us in December.

The partnership owns a controlling interest in Berkshire Hathaway Inc., a publicly-traded security. As mentioned in my midyear letter, asset values and earning power are the dominant factors affecting the valuation of a controlling interest in a business. Market price, which governs valuation of minority interest positions, is of little or no importance in valuing a controlling interest. We will value our position in Berkshire Hathaway at yearend at a price halfway between net current asset value and book value. Because of the nature of our receivables and inventory this, in effect, amounts to valuation of our current assets at 100 cents on the dollar and our fixed assets at 50 cents on the dollar. Such a value in my opinion is fair to both adding and withdrawing partners. It may be either of lower than market value at the time.

As I write this, we are orbiting in quite satisfactory fashion. Our margin over the Dow is well above average, and even those Neanderthal partners who utilize such crude yardsticks as net profit would find performance satisfactory. This is all, of course, subject to substantial change by yearend.

If anything needs clarification, call or write John Harding who is in charge of "de-confusing" partners. The tax situation is about as reported in the August letter, but if you would like John to make the calculation for you, he will be glad to do it.

Cordially,

Warren E. Buffett

P/S: We are continuing our "no prize" policy for the last ones to get their commitment letters back to us. It will make things easier for us if you get it back pronto. If you want to make changes later (before January lst), just give us a call, and we'll amend it for you.

**Our Performance in 1965**

Our War on Poverty was successful in 1965.

Specially, we were $12,304,060 less poor at the end of the year.

Last year under a section in the annual letter entitled “Our Goal” (please particularly note it was not headed "Our Promise"), I stated we were trying to achieve “… An average advantage (relative to the Dow) of ten percentage points per annum for BPL before allocation to the general partner again with large amplitudes in the margin from perhaps 10 percentage points worse than the Dow in a bad year to 25 percentage points better when everything clicks.”

My fallibility as a forecaster was quickly demonstrated when the first year fell outside my parameters. We achieved our widest margin over the Dow in the history of BPL with an overall gain of 47.2% compared to an overall gain (including dividends which would have been received through ownership of the Dow) of 14.2% for the Dow. Naturally, no writer likes to be publicly humiliated by such a mistake. It is unlikely to be repeated.

The following summarizes the year-by-year performance of the Dow, the performance of the Partnership before allocation (one quarter of the excess over 6%) to the general partner, and the results for limited partners: 

|年份（Year）|道琼斯总体业绩（1）（Overall Results From Dow (1)）|合伙业绩（2）（Partnership Results (2)）|有限合伙人业绩（3）（Limited Partners’ Results (3)）|
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
|1957年| -8.4%|10.4%|9.3%|
|1958年|38.5%|40.9%|32.2%|
|1959年|20.0%|25.9%|20.9%|
|1960年| -6.2%|22.8%|18.6%|
|1961年|22.4%|45.9%|35.9%|
|1962年| -7.6%|13.9%|11.9%|
|1963年|20.6%|38.7%|30.5%|
|1964年|18.7%|27.8%|22.3%|
|1965年|14.2%|47.2%|36.9%|

(1) Based on yearly changes in the value of the Dow plus dividends that would have been received through ownership of the Dow during that year. The table includes all complete years of partnership activity.

(2) For 1957-61 consists of combined results of all predecessor limited partnerships operating throughout the entire year after all expenses, but before distributions to partners or allocations to the general partner.

(3) For 1957-61 computed on the basis of the preceding column of partnership results allowing for allocation to the general partner based upon the present partnership agreement, but before monthly withdrawals by limited partners.

On a cumulative or compounded basis, the results are:

|年份（Year）|道琼斯总体业绩（Overall Results From Dow）|合伙业绩（Partnership Results）|有限合伙人业绩（Limited Partners’ Results）|
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
|1957年| -8.4%|10.4%|9.3%|
|1957 - 1958年|26.9%|55.6%|44.5%|
|1957 - 1959年|52.3%|95.9%|74.7%|
|1957 - 1960年|42.9%|140.6%|107.2%|
|1957 - 1961年|74.9%|251.0%|181.6%|
|1957 - 1962年|61.6%|299.8%|215.1%|
|1957 - 1963年|95.1%|454.5%|311.2%|
|1957 - 1964年|131.3%|608.7%|402.9%|
|1957 - 1965年|164.1%|943.2%|588.5%|
|年复合收益率（Annual Compounded Rate）|11.4%|29.8%|23.9%|

After last year the question naturally arises, "What do we do for an encore?” A disadvantage of this business is that it does not possess momentum to any significant degree. If General Motors accounts for 54% of domestic new car registrations in 1965, it is a pretty safe bet that they are going to come fairly close to that figure in 1966 due to owner loyalties, dealer capabilities, productive capacity, consumer image, etc. Not so for BPL. We start from scratch each year with everything valued at market when the gun goes off. Partners in 1966, new or old, benefit to only a very limited extent from the efforts of 1964 and 1965. The success of past methods and ideas does not transfer forward to future ones.

I continue to hope, on a longer-range basis, for the sort of achievement outlined in the "Our Goal" section of last year's letter (copies still available). However, those who believe 1965 results can be achieved with any frequency are probably attending weekly meetings of the Halley’s Comet Observers Club. We are going to have loss years and are going to have years inferior to the Dow - no doubt about it. But I continue to believe we can achieve average performance superior to the Dow in the future. If my expectation regarding this should change, you will hear immediately.

**Investment Companies**

We regularly compare our results with the two largest open-end investment companies (mutual funds) that follow a policy of being typically 95% - 100% invested in common stocks, and the two largest diversified closed-end investment companies. These four companies, Massachusetts Investors Trust, Investors Stock Fund, Tri-Continental Corp., and Lehman Corp. manage over $5 billion, are owned by about 600,000 shareholders, and are probably typical of most of the $35 billion investment company industry. My opinion is that their results roughly parallel those of the overwhelming majority of other investment advisory organizations which handle, in aggregate, vastly greater sums.

The purpose of this tabulation is to illustrate that the Dow is no pushover as an index of investment achievement. The advisory talent managing just the four companies shown commands annual fees of about $10 million and this represents a very small fraction of the professional investment management industry. The public batting average of this highly paid and widely respected talent indicates performance a shade below that of the Dow, an unmanaged index.

A number of the largest investment advisory operations (managing, in some cases, well into the billions of dollars) also manage investment companies partly as a convenience for smaller clients and partly as a public showcase. The results of these funds roughly parallel those of the four funds on which we report.

I strongly believe in measurement. The investment managers mentioned above utilize measurement constantly in their activities. They constantly study changes in market shares, profit margins, return on capital, etc. Their entire decision-making process is geared to measurement - of managements, industries, comparative yields, etc. I am sure they keep score on their new business efforts as well as the profitability of their advisory operation. What then can be more fundamental than the measurement, in turn, of investment ideas and decisions? I certainly do not believe the standards I utilize (and wish my partners to utilize) in measuring my performance are the applicable ones for all money managers. But I certainly do believe anyone engaged in the management of money should have a standard of measurement, and that both he and the party whose money is managed should have a clear understanding why it is the appropriate standard, what time period should be utilized, etc.

Frank Block put it very well in the November-December 1965 issue of the Financial Analysts Journal. Speaking of measurement of investment performance he said," ...However, the fact is that literature suffers a yawning hiatus in this subject. If investment management organizations sought always the best performance, there would be nothing unique in careful measurement of investment results. It does not matter that the customer has failed to ask for a formal presentation of the results. Pride alone should be sufficient to demand that each or us determine objectively the quality of his recommendations. This can hardly be done without precise knowledge of the outcome. Once this knowledge is in hand, it should be possible to extend the analysis to some point at which patterns of weakness and strength begin to assert themselves. We criticize a corporate management for failure to use the best of tools to keep it aware of the progress of a complicated industrial organization. We can hardly be excused for failure to provide ourselves with equal tools to show the efficiency of our own efforts to handle other people’s money. ...Thus, it is our dreary duty to report that systems of performance measurement are not automatically included in the data processing programs of most investment management organizations. The sad fact is that some seem to prefer not to know how well or poorly they are doing. 

Frankly, I have several selfish reasons for insisting that we apply a yardstick and that we both utilize the same yardstick. Naturally, I get a kick out of beating par - in the lyrical words of Casey Stengel, "Show me a good loser, and I’ll show you a loser.” More importantly, I insure that I will not get blamed for the wrong reason (having losing years) but only for the right reason (doing poorer than the Dow). Knowing partners will grade me on the right basis helps me do a better job. Finally, setting up the relevant yardsticks ahead of time insures that we will all get out of this business if the results become mediocre (or worse). It means that past successes cannot cloud judgment of current results. It should reduce the chance of ingenious rationalizations of inept performance. (Bad lighting has been bothering me at the bridge table lately.) While this masochistic approach to measurement may not sound like much of an advantage, I can assure you from my observations of business entities that such evaluation would have accomplished a great deal in many investment and industrial organizations.

So if you are evaluating others (or yourself!) in the investment field, think out some standards - apply them -interpret them. If you do not feel our standard (a minimum of a three-year test versus the Dow) is an applicable one, you should not be in the Partnership. If you do feel it is applicable, you should be able to take the minus years with equanimity in the visceral regions as well as the cerebral regions -as long as we are surpassing the results of the Dow.

**The Sorrows of Compounding**

Usually, at this point in my letter, I have paused to modestly attempt to set straight the historical errors of the last four or five hundred years. While it might seem difficult to accomplish this in only a few paragraphs a year, I feel I have done my share to reshape world opinion on Columbus, Isabella, Francis I, Peter Minuit and the Manhattan Indians. A by-product of this endeavor has been to demonstrate the overwhelming power of compound interest. To insure reader attention I have entitled these essays "The Joys of Compounding. " The sharp-eyed may notice a slight change this year.

A decent rate (better we have an indecent rate) of compound -plus the addition of substantial new money has brought our beginning capital this year to $43,645,000. Several times in the past I have raised the question whether increasing amounts of capital would harm our investment performance. Each time I have answered negatively and promised you that if my opinion changed, I would promptly report it.

I do not feel that increased capital has hurt our operation to date. As a matter of fact, I believe that we have done somewhat better during the past few years with the capital we have had in the Partnership than we would have done if we had been working with a substantially smaller amount. This was due to the partly fortuitous development of several investments that were just the right size for us -big enough to be significant and small enough to handle.

I now feel that we are much closer to the point where increased size may prove disadvantageous. I don't want to ascribe too much precision to that statement since there are many variables involved. What may be the optimum size under some market and business circumstances can be substantially more or less than optimum under other circumstances. There have been a few times in the past when on a very short-term basis I have felt it would have been advantageous to be smaller but substantially more times when the converse was true.

Nevertheless, as circumstances presently appear, I feel substantially greater size is more likely to harm future results than to help them. This might not be true for my own personal results, but it is likely to be true for your results.

Therefore, unless it appears that circumstances have changed (under some conditions added capital would improve results) or unless new partners can bring some asset to the Partnership other than simply capital, I intend to admit no additional partners to BPL.

The only way to make this effective is to apply it across-the-board and I have notified Susie that if we have any more children, it is up to her to find some other partnership for them.

Because I anticipate that withdrawals (for taxes, among other reasons) may well approach additions by present partners and also because I visualize the curve of expectable performance sloping only very mildly as capital increases, I presently see no reason why we should restrict capital additions by existing partners.The medically oriented probably will interpret this entire section as conclusive evidence that an effective antithyroid pill has been developed.

**Trends in Our Business**

Last year I discussed our various categories of investments. Knowing the penalties for cruel and unusual punishments, I will skip a rehash of the characteristics of each category, but merely refer you to last year's letter. However, a few words should be said to bring you up to date on the various segments of the business, and perhaps to give you a better insight into their strengths and weaknesses.

The "Workout" business has become very spasmodic. We were able to employ an average of only about $6 million during the year in the Workout section, and this involved only a very limited number of situations. Although we earned about $1,410,000 or about 23 ½% on average capital employed (this is calculated on an all equity basis - borrowed money is appropriate in most Workout situations, and we utilize it, which improves our rate of return above this percentage), over half of this was earned from one situation. I think it unlikely that a really interesting rate of return can be earned consistently on large sums of money in this business under present conditions. Nevertheless, we will continue to try to remain alert for the occasional important opportunity and probably continue to utilize a few of the smaller opportunities where we like the probabilities.

The "Generals-Private Owner Basis" category was very good to us in 1965. Opportunities in this area have become more scarce with a rising Dow, but when they come along, they are often quite significant. I mentioned at the start of last year that we were the largest stockholder of three companies in this category. Our largest yearend 1964 investment in this category was disposed of in 1965 pursuant to a tender offer resulting in a realized gain for BPL of $3,188,000. At yearend 1964 we had unrealized appreciation in this investment of $451,000. Therefore, the economic gain attributable to 1965 for this transaction was only $2,737,000 even though the entire tax effect fell in that year. I mention these figures to illustrate how our realized gain for tax purposes in any year bears no necessary relationship to our economic gain.

The fundamental concept underlying the Generals-Private Owner category is demonstrated by the above case. A private owner was quite willing (and in our opinion quite wise) to pay a price for control of the business which isolated stock buyers were not willing to pay for very small fractions of the business. This has been a quite common condition in the securities markets over many years, and although purchases in this category work out satisfactorily in terms of just general stock market behavior, there is the occasional dramatic profit due to corporate action such as the one above.

The "Control" section of our business received a transfer member from our “Private Owner” category. Shares in Berkshire Hathaway had been acquired since November 1962 on much the same line of reasoning as prevailed in the security mentioned above. In the case of Berkshire, however, we ended up purchasing enough stock to assume a controlling position ourselves rather than the more usual case of either selling our stock in the market or to another single buyer.

Our purchases of Berkshire started at a price of $7.60 per share in 1962. This price partially reflected large losses incurred by the prior management in closing some of the mills made obsolete by changing conditions within the textile business (which the old management had been quite slow to recognize). In the postwar period the company had slid downhill a considerable distance, having hit a peak in 1948 when about $29 1/2 million was earned before tax and about 11,000 workers were employed. This reflected output from 11 mills.

At the time we acquired control in spring of 1965, Berkshire was down to two mills and about 2,300 employees. It was a very pleasant surprise to find that the remaining units had excellent management personnel, and we have not had to bring a single man from the outside into the operation. In relation to our beginning acquisition cost of $7.60 per share (the average cost, however, was $14.86 per share, reflecting very heavy purchases in early 1965), the company on December 31, 1965, had net working capital alone (before placing any value on the plants and equipment) of about $19 per share.

Berkshire is a delight to own. There is no question that the state of the textile industry is the dominant factor in determining the earning power of the business, but we are most fortunate to have Ken Chace running the business in a first-class manner, and we also have several of the best sales people in the business heading up this end of their respective divisions.

While a Berkshire is hardly going to be as profitable as a Xerox, Fairchild Camera or National Video in a hypertensed market, it is a very comfort able sort of thing to own. As my West Coast philosopher says, “It is well to have a diet consisting of oatmeal as well as cream puffs.”

Because of our controlling interest, our investment in Berkshire is valued for our audit as a business, not as a marketable security. If Berkshire advances $5 per share in the market, it does BPL no good - our holdings are not going to be sold. Similarly, if it goes down $5 per share, it is not meaningful to us. The value of our holding is determined directly by the value of the business. I received no divine inspiration in that valuation of our holdings. (Maybe the owners of the three wonder stocks mentioned above do receive such a message in respect to their holdings -I feel I would need something at least that reliable to sleep well at present prices.) I attempt to apply a conservative valuation based upon my knowledge of assets, earning power, industry conditions, competitive position, etc. We would not be a seller of our holdings at such a figure, but neither would we be a seller of the other items in our portfolio at yearend valuations –otherwise, we would already have sold them.

Our final category is "Generals-Relatively Undervalued.” This category has been growing in relative importance as opportunities in the other categories become less frequent.

Frankly, operating in this field is somewhat more ethereal than operating in the other three categories, and I'm just not an ethereal sort. Therefore, I feel accomplishments here are less solid and perhaps less meaningful for future projections than in the other categories. Nevertheless, our results in 1965 were quite good in the “Relatively Undervalued” group, partly due to implementation of the technique referred to in last year's letter which serves to reduce risk and potentially augment gains. It should reduce risk in any year, and it definitely augmented the gains in 1965. It is necessary to point out that results in this category were greatly affected for the better by only two investments.

Candor also demands I point out that during 1965 we had our worst single investment experience in the history 
of BPL on one idea in this group.

Overall, we had more than our share of good breaks in 1965. We did not have a great quantity of ideas, but the quality, with the one important exception mentioned above, was very good and circumstances developed which accelerated the timetable in several. I do not have a great flood of good ideas as I go into 1966, although again I believe I have at least several potentially good ideas of substantial size. Much depends on whether market conditions are favorable for obtaining a larger position.

All in all, however, you should recognize that more came out of the pipeline in 1965 than went in.

**Diversification**

Last year in commenting on the inability of the overwhelming majority of investment managers to achieve performance superior to that of pure chance, I ascribed it primarily to the product of: "(1) group decisions - my perhaps jaundiced view is that it is close to impossible for outstanding investment management to come from a group of any size with all parties really participating in decisions; (2) a desire to conform to the policies and (to an extent) the portfolios of other large well-regarded organizations; (3) an institutional framework whereby average is "safe" and the personal rewards for independent action are in no way commensurate with the general risk attached to such action; (4) an adherence to certain diversification practices which are irrational; and finally and importantly, (5) inertia.”

This year in the material which went out in November, I specifically called your attention to a new Ground Rule reading, "7. We diversify substantially less than most investment operations. We might invest up to 40% of our net worth in a single security under conditions coupling an extremely high probability that our facts and reasoning are correct with a very low probability that anything could drastically change the underlying value of the investment."

We are obviously following a policy regarding diversification which differs markedly from that of practically all public investment operations. Frankly, there is nothing I would like better than to have 50 different investment opportunities, all of which have a mathematical expectation (this term reflects the range of all possible relative performances, including negative ones, adjusted for the probability of each - no yawning, please) of achieving performance surpassing the Dow by, say, fifteen percentage points per annum. If the fifty individual expectations were not intercorelated (what happens to one is associated with what happens to the other) I could put 2% of our capital into each one and sit back with a very high degree of certainty that our overall results would be very close to such a fifteen percentage point advantage.

It doesn't work that way.

We have to work extremely hard to find just a very few attractive investment situations. Such a situation by definition is one where my expectation (defined as above) of performance is at least ten percentage points per annum superior to the Dow. Among the few we do find, the expectations vary substantially. The question always is, “How much do I put in number one (ranked by expectation of relative performance) and how much do I put in number eight?" This depends to a great degree on the wideness of the spread between the mathematical expectation of number one versus number eight.” It also depends upon the probability that number one could turn in a really poor relative performance. Two securities could have equal mathematical expectations, but one might have .05 chance of performing fifteen percentage points or more worse than the Dow, and the second might have only .01 chance of such performance. The wider range of expectation in the first case reduces the desirability of heavy concentration in it. 

The above may make the whole operation sound very precise. It isn't. Nevertheless, our business is that of ascertaining facts and then applying experience and reason to such facts to reach expectations. Imprecise and emotionally influenced as our attempts may be, that is what the business is all about. The results of many years of decision-making in securities will demonstrate how well you are doing on making such calculations - whether you consciously realize you are making the calculations or not. I believe the investor operates at a distinct advantage when he is aware of what path his thought process is following.

There is one thing of which I can assure you. If good performance of the fund is even a minor objective, any portfolio encompassing one hundred stocks (whether the manager is handling one thousand dollars or one billion dollars) is not being operated logically. The addition of the one hundredth stock simply can't reduce the potential variance in portfolio performance sufficiently to compensate for the negative effect its inclusion has on the overall portfolio expectation.

Anyone owning such numbers of securities after presumably studying their investment merit (and I don't care how prestigious their labels) is following what I call the Noah School of Investing - two of everything. Such investors should be piloting arks. While Noah may have been acting in accord with certain time-tested biological principles, the investors have left the track regarding mathematical principles. (I only made it through plane geometry, but with one exception, I have carefully screened out the mathematicians from our Partnership.)

Of course, the fact that someone else is behaving illogically in owning one hundred securities doesn't prove our case. While they may be wrong in overdiversifying, we have to affirmatively reason through a proper diversification policy in terms of our objectives.

The optimum portfolio depends on the various expectations of choices available and the degree of variance in performance which is tolerable. The greater the number of selections, the less will be the average year-to-year variation in actual versus expected results. Also, the lower will be the expected results, assuming different choices have different expectations of performance.

I am willing to give up quite a bit in terms of leveling of year-to-year results (remember when I talk of “results,” I am talking of performance relative to the Dow) in order to achieve better overall long-term performance. Simply stated, this means I am willing to concentrate quite heavily in what I believe to be the best investment opportunities recognizing very well that this may cause an occasional very sour year - one somewhat more sour, probably, than if I had diversified more. While this means our results will bounce around more, I think it also means that our long-term margin of superiority should be greater.

You have already seen some examples of this. Our margin versus the Dow has ranged from 2.4 percentage points in 1958 to 33.0 points in 1965. If you check this against the deviations of the funds listed on page three, you will find our variations have a much wider amplitude. I could have operated in such a manner as to reduce our amplitude, but I would also have reduced our overall performance somewhat although it still would have substantially exceeded that of the investment companies. Looking back, and continuing to think this problem through, I feel that if anything, I should have concentrated slightly more than I have in the past. Hence, the new Ground Rule and this long-winded explanation.

Again let me state that this is somewhat unconventional reasoning (this doesn't make it right or wrong - it does mean you have to do your own thinking on it), and you may well have a different opinion - if you do, the Partnership is not the place for you. We are obviously only going to go to 40% in very rare situations - this rarity, of course, is what makes it necessary that we concentrate so heavily, when we see such an opportunity. We probably have had only five or six situations in the nine-year history of the Partnership where we have exceeded 25%. Any such situations are going to have to promise very significantly superior performance relative to the Dow compared to other opportunities available at the time. They are also going to have to possess such superior qualitative and/or quantitative factors that the chance of serious permanent loss is minimal (anything can happen on a short-term quotational basis which partially explains the greater risk of widened year-to-year variation in results). In selecting the limit to which I will go in anyone investment, I attempt to reduce to a tiny figure the probability that the single investment (or group, if there is intercorrelation) can produce a result for our total portfolio that would be more than ten percentage points poorer than the Dow.

We presently have two situations in the over 25% category - one a controlled company, and the other a large company where we will never take an active part. It is worth pointing out that our performance in 1965 was overwhelmingly the product of five investment situations. The 1965 gains (in some cases there were also gains applicable to the same holding in prior years) from these situations ranged from about $800,000 to about $3 1/2 million. If you should take the overall performance of our five smallest general investments in 1965, the results are lackluster (I chose a very charitable adjective).

Interestingly enough, the literature of investment management is virtually devoid of material relative to deductive calculation of optimal diversification.All texts counsel "adequate" diversification, but the ones who quantify "adequate" virtually never explain how they arrive at their conclusion. Hence, for our summation on overdiversification, we turn to that eminent academician Billy Rose, who says, "You've got a harem of seventy girls; you don't get to know any of them very well.”

**Miscellaneous**

Last year we boldly announced an expansion move, encompassing an additional 227 1/4 square feet. Older partners shook their heads. I feel that our gain from operations in 1965 of $12,304,060 indicates that we did not overextend ourselves. Fortunately, we didn't sign a percentage lease. Operationally, things have never been running more smoothly, and I think our present setup unquestionably lets me devote a higher percentage of my time to thinking about the investment process than virtually anyone else in the money management business. This, of course, is the result of really outstanding personnel and cooperative partners.

John Harding has taken complete charge of all administrative operations with splendid results. Bill Scott continues to develop detailed information on investments which substantially enhances our net profit figure. Beth Feehan, Donna Walter and Elizabeth Hanon (who joined us in November) have all handled large work loads (secretary's note -Amen!) accurately and efficiently.

The above people, their spouses (one apiece) and children have a combined investment in the Partnership of over $600,000. Susie and I have an investment of $6,849,936, which should keep me from slipping away to the movies in the afternoon. This represents virtually our entire net worth, with the exception of our continued holding of Mid-Continent Tab Card, a local company into which I bought in 1960 when it had less than 10 stockholders.

Additionally, my relatives, consisting of three children, mother, two sisters, two brothers-in-law, father-in-law, three aunts, two uncles, five cousins, and six nieces and nephews have interests in BPL, directly or indirectly, totaling $2,708,233. So don't get any ideas about voting a change in the Partnership name.

Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co. has done the customary excellent job of expediting the audit and tax information. This requires great effort and ability, and they supply both. This year a computer was brought to bear on our problems, and naturally, I was a little worried someone else would come out as the general partner. However, it all worked quite smoothly.

Within the coming two weeks you will receive:

1. A tax letter giving you all BPL information needed for your 1965 federal income tax return. This letter is the only item that counts for tax purposes.
2. An audit from Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co. for 1965, setting forth the operations and financialposition of BPL, as well as your own capital account.
3. A letter signed by me setting forth the status of your BPL interest on 1/1/66. This is identical with the figures developed in the audit.

Let me know if anything in this letter or that occurs during the year needs clarifying. It is difficult to anticipate all of the questions you may have and if there is anything that is confusing, I want to hear about it. For instance, we received an excellent suggestion last year from a partner regarding the presentation of the reconciliation of personal capital accounts.

My next letter will be about July 15th, summarizing the first ha1f of this year.

Cordially,

Warren E. Buffett

#### First Half Performance

During the first half of 1966, the Dow-Jones Industrial Average (hereinafter called the "Dow") declined from 969.26 to 870.10. If one had owned the Dow during this period, dividends of approximately 14.70 would have been received, reducing the overall loss of the Dow to about 8.7%.

It is my objective and my hope (but not my prediction!) that we achieve over a long period of time, an average yearly advantage of ten percentage points relative to the Dow. During the first half we did considerably better than expected with an overall gain of approximately 8.2%. Such results should be regarded as decidedly abnormal. I have previously complimented partners on the good-natured tolerance they display in shrugging off such unexpected positive variances. The nature of our business is such that over the years, we will not disappoint the many of you who must also desire a test of your capacity for tolerance of negative variances.

The following summarizes the year-by-year performance of the Dow, the performance of the Partnership before allocation to the general partner, and the results for limited partners:

1. Based on yearly changes in the value of the Dow plus dividends that would have been received through ownership of the Dow during that year. The table includes all complete years of partnership activity.
2. For 1957-61 consists of combined results of all predecessor limited partnerships operating throughout the entire year after all expenses but before distributions to partners or allocations to the general partner.
3. For 1957-61 computed on the basis of the preceding column of partnership results allowing for allocation to the general partner based upon the present partnership agreement, but before monthly withdrawals by limited partners.

Even Samson gets clipped occasionally. If you had invested $100.000 on January 1 equally among -

a. the world's largest auto company (General Motors);
b. the world's largest oil company (Standard of New Jersey);
c. the world's largest retailing company (Sears Roebuck);
d. the world's largest chemical company (Dupont);
e. the world's largest steel company (U.S. Steel);
f. the world's largest stockholder-owned insurance company (Aetna);
g. the world’s largest public utility (American Telephone & Telegraph);
h. the world's largest bank (Bank of America);

your total portfolio (including dividends received) would have been worth $83,370 on June 30 for a loss of 16.6%. The total market value on January 1 of these eight giants was well over $100 billion. Everyone of them was selling lower on June 30.

**Investment Companies**

On the next page we bring up to date our regular comparison with the results of the two largest open-end investment companies (mutual funds) that follow a policy of being, typically, 95-100% invested in common stocks, and the two largest diversified closed-end investment companies.

Proponents of institutional investing frequently cite its conservative nature. If “conservative” is interpreted to mean "productive of results varying only slightly from average experience" I believe the characterization is proper. Such results are almost bound to flow from wide diversification among high grade securities. Since, over a long period, "average experience" is likely to be good experience, there is nothing wrong with the typical investor utilizing this form of investment medium.

However, I believe that conservatism is more properly interpreted to mean "subject to substantially less temporary or permanent shrinkage in value than total experience". This simply has not been achieved, as the record of the four largest funds (presently managing over $5 billion) illustrates. Specifically, the Dow declined in 1957, 1960, 1962 and the first half of 1966. Cumulating the shrinkage in the Dow during the three full year periods produces a decline of 20.6%. Following a similar technique for the four largest funds produces declines of 9.7%, 20.9%, 22.3% and 24.6%. Including the interim performance for the first half of 1966 results in a decline in the Dow of 27.5% and for the funds declines of 14.4%, 23.1%, 27.1% and 30.6%. Such funds (and I believe their results are quite typical of institutional experience in common stocks) seem to meet the first definition of conservatism but not the second one.

Most investors would climb a rung intellectually if they clearly delineated between the above two interpretations of conservatism. The first might be better labeled "conventionalism" - what it really says is that “when others are making money in the general run of securities, so will we and to about the same degree; when they are losing money, we'll do it at about the same rate." This is not to be equated with "when others are making it, we'll make as much and when they are losing it, we will lose less.” Very few investment programs accomplish the latter -we certainly don't promise it but we do intend to keep trying. (I have always felt our objectives should be somewhat loftier than those Herman Hickman articulated during the desperate years when Yale was losing eight games a season. Said Herman, "I see my job as one of keeping the alumni sullen but not mutinous.”)

**Hochschild, Kohn & Co.**

During the first half we, and two 10% partners, purchased all of the stock of Hochschild, Kohn & Co., a privately owned Baltimore department store. This is the first time in the history of the Partnership that an entire business has been purchased by negotiation, although we have, from time to time, negotiated purchase of specific important blocks of marketable securities. However, no new principles are involved. The quantitative and qualitative aspects of the business are evaluated and weighed against price, both on an absolute basis and relative to other investment opportunities. HK (learn to call it that - I didn't find out how to pronounce it until the deal was concluded) stacks up fine in all respects.

We have topnotch people (both from a personal and business standpoint) handling the operation. Despite the edge that my extensive 75 cents an hour experience at the Penney's store in Omaha some years back gives us (I became an authority on the Minimum Wage Act), they will continue to run the business as in the past. Even if the price had been cheaper but the management had been run-of-the-mill, we would not have bought the business.

It is impossible to avoid some public notice when a business with several thousand employees is acquired. However, it is important that you do not infer the degree of financial importance to BPL from its news value to the public. We have something over $50 million invested, primarily in marketable securities, of which only about 10% is represented by our net investment in HK. We have an investment of over three times this much in a marketable security where our ownership will never come to public attention. This is not to say an HK is not important - a 10% holding definitely is. However, it is not as significant relative to our total operation as it would be easy to think. I still prefer the iceberg approach toward investment disclosure.

It is my intention to value HK at yearend at cost plus our share of retained earnings since purchase. This policy will be followed in future years unless there is a demonstrable change in our position relative to other department stores or in other objective standards of value. Naturally we wouldn't have purchased HK unless we felt the price was quite attractive. Therefore, a valuation policy based upon cost may somewhat undervalue our holdings. Nevertheless, it seems the most objective figure to apply. All of our investments usually appear undervalued to me - otherwise we wouldn't own them.

**Market Forecasting**

Ground Rule No.6 (from our November packet) says: “I am not in the business of predicting general stock market or business fluctuations. If you think I can do this, or think it is essential to an investment program, you should not be in the partnership.”

Of course, this rule can be attacked as fuzzy, complex, ambiguous, vague, etc. Nevertheless, I think the point is well understood by the great majority of our partners. We don't buy and sell stocks based upon what other people think the stock market is going to do (I never have an opinion) but rather upon what we think the company is going to do. The course of the stock market will determine, to a great degree, when we will be right, but the accuracy of our analysis of the company will largely determine whether we will be right. In other words, we tend to concentrate on what should happen, not when it should happen.

In our department store business I can say with considerable assurance that December will be better than July. (Notice how sophisticated I have already become about retailing.) What really counts is whether December is better than last December by a margin greater than our competitors' and what we are doing to set the stage for future Decembers. However, in our partnership business I not only can't say whether December will be better than July, but I can't even say that December won't produce a very large loss. It sometimes does. Our investments are simply not aware that it takes 365-1/4 days for the earth to make it around the sun. Even worse, they are not aware that your celestial orientation (and that of the IRS) requires that I report to you upon the conclusion of each orbit (the earth's - not ours). Therefore, we have to use a standard other than the calendar to measure our progress. This yardstick is obviously the general experience in securities as measured by the Dow. We have a strong feeling that this competitor will do quite decently over a period of years (Christmas will come even if it's in July) and if we keep beating our competitor we will have to do something better than "quite decently". It's something like a retailer measuring his sales gains and profit margins against Sears' - beat them every year and somehow you'll see daylight.

I resurrect this "market-guessing" section only because after the Dow declined from 995 at the peak in February to about 865 in May, I received a few calls from partners suggesting that they thought stocks were going a lot lower. This always raises two questions in my mind: (1) if they knew in February that the Dow was going to 865 in May, why didn't they let me in on it then; and, (2) if they didn't know what was going to happen during the ensuing three months back in February, how do they know in May? There is also a voice or two after any hundred point or so decline suggesting we sell and wait until the future is clearer. Let me again suggest two points: (1) the future has never been clear to me (give us a call when the next few months are obvious to you –or, for that matter the next few hours); and, (2) no one ever seems to call after the market has gone up one hundred points to focus my attention on how unclear everything is, even though the view back in February doesn't look so clear in retrospect.

If we start deciding, based on guesses or emotions, whether we will or won't participate in a business where we should have some long run edge, we're in trouble. We will not sell our interests in businesses (stocks) when they are attractively priced just because some astrologer thinks the quotations may go lower even though such forecasts are obviously going to be right some of the time. Similarly, we will not buy fully priced securities because "experts" think prices are going higher. Who would think of buying or selling a private business because of someone's guess on the stock market? The availability of a question for your business interest (stock) should always be an asset to be utilized if desired. If it gets silly enough in either direction, you take advantage of it. Its availability should never be turned into a liability whereby its periodic aberrations in turn formulate your judgments. A marvelous articulation of this idea is contained in chapter two (The Investor and Stock Market Fluctuations) of Benjamin Graham's "The Intelligent Investor". In my opinion, this chapter has more investment importance than anything else that has been written.

We will have a letter out about November 1 with the Commitment Letter for 1967 and an estimate of the 1966 tax situation.

Cordially,

Warren Buffett
