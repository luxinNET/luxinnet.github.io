1962年7月6日

_A Reminder:_

_提醒：_

In my letter of January 24, 1962 reporting on 1961, I inserted a section entitled. "And a Prediction." While I have no desire to inflict cruel and unusual punishment upon my readers, nevertheless, a reprinting of that section, in its entirety, may be worthwhile: 

在我 1962年1月24日汇报1961年情况的信件中，插入了一个名为 “一个预测” 的章节。虽然我不想给读者带来残酷和不寻常的 “惩罚”，但全文重印该章节或许是有价值的：

    _And a Prediction_

    _一个预测_

    Regular readers (I may be flattering myself) will feel I have left the tracks when I start talking about predictions. This is one thing from which I have always shied away and I still do in the normal sense. 

    老读者（或许是我自夸了）可能会觉得，当我开始谈论预测时，就偏离了正轨。这是我一直回避的事情，通常情况下现在也依然如此。

    I am certainly not going to predict what general business or the stock market are going to do in the next year or two since I don't have the faintest idea.

    我当然不会预测未来一两年内整体商业形势或股市的走势，因为我完全没有头绪。

    I think you can be quite sure that over the next ten years there are going to be a few years when the  general market is plus 20% or 25%, a few when it is minus on the same order, and a majority when it is in between. I haven't any notion as to the sequence in which these will occur, nor do I think it is of any great importance for the long-term investor.

    我认为你可以十分确定，在未来十年里，会有几年股市大盘上涨 20% 或 25%，也会有几年下跌相同幅度，而大多数年份涨跌幅度介于两者之间。我不清楚这些情况出现的先后顺序，而且我认为这对长期投资者来说也并非至关重要。

    Over any long period of years, I think it likely that the Dow will probably produce something like 5% to 7% per year compounded from a combination of dividends and market value gain. Despite the experience of recent years, anyone expecting substantially better than that from the general market probably faces disappointment.

    在任何较长的时间段内，我认为道琼斯指数很可能会通过股息和市值增长的综合作用，实现每年约 5% 至 7% 的复合增长率。尽管近年来市场表现有所不同，但任何期望股市大盘表现大幅优于这一水平的人，可能都会失望。

    Our job is to pile up yearly advantages over the performance of the Dow without worrying too much about whether the absolute results in a given year are a plus or a minus. I would consider a year in which we were down 15% and the Dow declined 25% to be much superior to a year when both the partnership and the Dow advanced 20%. I have stressed this point in talking with partners and have watched them nod their heads with varying degrees of enthusiasm.

    我们的工作是每年都要在业绩上超越道琼斯指数，而不必过于担心某一年的绝对业绩是正还是负。我会认为，在我们下跌 15% 而道琼斯指数下跌 25% 的年份，要比我们和道琼斯指数都上涨 20% 的年份好得多。我在与合伙人交谈时强调过这一点，看到他们不同程度地点头表示认同。

    It is most important to me that you fully understand my reasoning in this regard and agree with me not only in your cerebral regions, but also down in the pit of your stomach.

    对我来说，最重要的是你能完全理解我在这方面的推理，不仅在理智上认同，更要从心底里认同。

    For the reasons outlined in my method of operation, our best years relative to the Dow are likely to be in declining or static markets. Therefore, the advantage we seek will probably come in sharply varying amounts. There are bound to be years when we are surpassed by the Dow, but if over a long period we can average ten percentage points per year better than it, I will feel the results have been satisfactory.

    基于我运营方法中概述的原因，相对于道琼斯指数，我们表现最佳的年份很可能出现在市场下跌或平稳时期。因此，我们所追求的优势幅度可能会有很大差异。必然会有一些年份，我们的表现不如道琼斯指数，但如果从长期来看，我们每年平均能比它高出 10 个百分点，我就会认为结果是令人满意的。

    Specifically, if the market should be down 35% or 40% in a year (and I feel this has a high probability of occurring one year in the next ten--no one knows which one), we should be down only 15% or 20%. If it is more or less unchanged during the year, we would hope to be up about ten percentage points. If it is up 20% or more, we would struggle to be up as much. The consequence of performance such as this over a period of years would mean that if the Dow produces a 5% to 7% per year over-all gain compounded, I would hope our results might be 15% to 17% per year.

    具体来说，如果某一年市场下跌 35% 或 40%（我觉得在未来十年里，很有可能会有这样一年 —— 没人知道是哪一年），我们的跌幅应该只有 15% 或 20%。如果当年市场基本持平，我们希望能上涨约 10 个百分点。如果市场上涨 20% 或更多，我们会努力跟上涨幅。如果多年来都保持这样的表现，那就意味着，如果道琼斯指数每年实现 5% 至 7% 的复合总涨幅，我希望我们的业绩能达到每年 15% 至 17%。

    The above expectations may sound somewhat rash, and there is no question but that they may appear very much so when viewed from the vantage point of 1965 or 1970. It may turn out that I am completely wrong. However, I feel the partners are certainly entitled to know what I am thinking in this regard even though the nature of the business is such as to introduce a high probability of error in such expectations. In anyone year, the variations may be quite substantial. This happened in 1961, but fortunately the variation was on the pleasant side. They won't all be!

    上述预期听起来可能有些草率，从 1965 年或 1970 年的角度来看，这些预期无疑会显得非常草率。结果也可能证明我完全错了。然而，我觉得合伙人当然有权知道我在这方面的想法，尽管这项业务的性质决定了这类预期很可能存在误差。在任何一年里，实际表现的差异可能都相当大。1961 年就是如此，幸运的是，那次差异是积极的。但不可能每次都这么幸运！

_The First Half of 1962:_

_1962 年上半年_

Between yearend 1961 and June 30, 1962 the Dow declined from 731.14 to 561.28. If one had owned the Dow 
during this period, dividends of approximately $11.00 would have been received so that overall a loss of 21.7% would have been the result of investing in the Dow. For the statistical minded, Appendix A gives the results of the Dow by years since formation of the predecessor partnerships.

1961 年底至 1962 年 6 月 30 日期间，道琼斯指数从 731.14 点跌至 561.28 点。如果在此期间持有道琼斯指数成分股，大约会获得 11.00 美元的股息，因此投资道琼斯指数的总体损失为 21.7%。对于喜欢统计数据的人，附录 A 列出了自前期合伙公司成立以来道琼斯指数各年度的表现。

As stated above, a declining Dow gives us our chance to shine and pile up the percentage advantages which, coupled with only an average performance during advancing markets, will give us quite satisfactory long-term results. Our target is an approximately 1/2% decline for each 1% decline in the Dow and if achieved, means we have a considerably more conservative vehicle for investment in stocks than practically any alternative.

如前所述，道琼斯指数下跌为我们提供了展现优势的机会，让我们能积累百分比优势。在上涨市场中我们只要保持平均表现，长期来看就能取得相当令人满意的结果。我们的目标是道琼斯指数每下跌 1%，我们的跌幅约为 0.5%。如果能实现这一目标，那就意味着我们的股票投资工具比几乎任何其他选择都更加保守。

As outlined in Appendix B, showing combined predecessor partnership results, during the first half of 1962 we had one of the best periods in our history, achieving a minus 7.5% result before payments to partners, compared to the minus 21.7% overall result on the Dow. This 14.2 percentage points advantage can be expected to widen during the second half if the decline in the general market continues, but will probably narrow should the market turn upward. Please keep in mind my continuing admonition that six-months' or even one-year's results are not to be taken too seriously. Short periods of measurement exaggerate chance fluctuations in performance. While circumstances contributed to an unusually good first half, there are bound to be periods when we do relatively poorly. The figures for our performance involve no change in the valuation of our controlling interest in Dempster Mill Manufacturing Company, although developments in recent months point toward a probable higher realization.

附录 B 展示了前期合伙公司的综合业绩。1962 年上半年，是我们历史上表现最好的时期之一，在向合伙人分配收益之前，业绩为负 7.5%，而道琼斯指数的总体业绩为负 21.7%。如果市场在下半年继续下跌，我们 14.2 个百分点的优势可能会进一步扩大；但如果市场回升，优势可能会缩小。请记住我一直的告诫，六个月甚至一年的业绩都不应被过度看重。短期的业绩衡量会夸大表现的偶然波动。虽然上半年的特殊情况带来了异常出色的表现，但肯定也会有我们表现相对较差的时期。我们的业绩数据并未考虑对邓普斯特磨坊制造公司（Dempster Mill Manufacturing Company）控股权估值的变化，不过最近几个月的发展表明，最终实现的价值可能会更高。

_Investment Companies during the First Half:_

_1962 年上半年投资公司表现_

Past letters have stressed our belief that the Dow is no pushover as a yardstick for investment performance. To the extent that funds are invested in common stocks, whether the manner of investment be through investment companies, investment counselors, bank trust departments, or do-it-yourself, our belief is that the overwhelming majority will achieve results roughly comparable to the Dow. Our opinion is that the deviations from the Dow are much more likely to be toward a poorer performance than a superior one.

过去的信件中我一直强调，道琼斯指数作为衡量投资业绩的标准并非轻易就能超越。就资金投资于普通股而言，无论投资方式是通过投资公司、投资顾问、银行信托部门，还是个人自主投资，我认为绝大多数的投资业绩大致与道琼斯指数相当。而且我认为，与道琼斯指数相比，投资业绩更可能是逊于它，而非优于它。

To illustrate this point, we have continually measured the Dow and limited partners' results against the two largest open-end investment companies (mutual funds) following a program of common stock investment and the two largest closed-end investment companies. The tabulation in Appendix C shows the five -years' results, and you will note the figures are extraordinarily close to those of the Dow. These companies have total assets of about $3.5 billion.

为了说明这一点，我们一直将道琼斯指数和有限合伙人的业绩，与两家最大的奉行普通股投资策略的开放式投资公司（共同基金）以及两家最大的封闭式投资公司进行对比。附录 C 中的表格展示了五年的业绩数据，你会注意到这些数据与道琼斯指数的非常接近。这些公司的总资产约为 35 亿美元。

In the interest of getting this letter out promptly, we are mailing it before results are available for the closed-end companies. However, the two mutual funds both did poorer than the Dow, with Massachusetts Investors Trust having a minus 23% overall performance, and Investors Stock Fund realizing a minus 25.4%. This is not unusual as witness the lead article in the WALL STREET JOURNAL of June 13, 1962 headed "Funds vs. Market.” Of the 17 large common stock funds studied, everyone had a record poorer than the Dow from the peak on the Dow of 734, to the date of the article, although in some cases the margin of inferiority was minor.

为了及时发出这封信，在封闭式投资公司的业绩数据出来之前，我们就开始邮寄信件了。不过，两家共同基金的表现都比道琼斯指数差，马萨诸塞投资者信托（Massachusetts Investors Trust）的总体业绩为负 23%，投资者股票基金（Investors Stock Fund）的总体业绩为负 25.4%。这并不罕见，1962 年 6 月 13 日《华尔街日报》一篇题为《基金与市场》的头条文章就可证明。在被研究的 17 家大型普通股基金中，从道琼斯指数达到 734 点的峰值到文章发表之日，每一家的业绩都比道琼斯指数差，尽管在某些情况下，差距较小。

Particularly hard hit in the first half were the so-called “growth” funds which, almost without exception, were down considerably more than the Dow. The three large "growth" (the quotation marks are more applicable now) funds with the best record in the preceding few years, Fidelity Capital Fund, Putnam Growth Fund, and Wellington Equity Fund averaged an overall minus 32.3% for the first half. It is only fair to point out that because of their excellent records in 1959-61, their overall performance to date isstill better than average, as it may well be in the future. Ironically, however, this earlier superior performance had caused such a rush of new investors to come to them that the poor performance this year was experienced by very many more holders than enjoyed the excellent performance of earlier years. This experience tends to confirm my hypothesis that investment performance must be judged over a period of time with such a period including both advancing and declining markets. There will continue to be both; a point perhaps better understood now than six months ago.

上半年受冲击特别严重的是所谓的 “成长型” 基金，几乎无一例外，它们的跌幅都远超道琼斯指数。在过去几年中业绩最佳的三只大型 “成长型”（现在 “成长型” 这个说法可能不太准确了）基金 —— 富达资本基金（Fidelity Capital Fund）、普特南成长基金（Putnam Growth Fund）和惠灵顿股票基金（Wellington Equity Fund），上半年的平均总体跌幅达到 32.3%。需要指出的是，由于它们在 1959 - 1961 年的出色业绩，到目前为止它们的总体表现仍优于平均水平，未来也很可能如此。具有讽刺意味的是，早期的卓越表现吸引了大量新投资者涌入，导致今年业绩不佳时，受影响的投资者数量远远多于享受过早期出色业绩的投资者。这一经历进一步证实了我的观点，即投资业绩必须在一个较长的时间段内进行评判，这个时间段应包括市场的上涨期和下跌期。市场涨跌的情况还会继续交替出现，这一点现在或许比六个月前更容易理解了。

In outlining the results of investment companies, I do so not because we operate in a manner comparable to them or because our investments are similar to theirs. It is done because such funds represent a public batting average of professional, highly-paid investment management handling a very significant $20 billion of securities. Such management, I believe, is typical of management handling even larger sums. As an alternative to an interest in the partnership, I believe it reasonable to assume that many partners would have investments managed similarly.

我之所以概述投资公司的业绩，并非因为我们的运营方式与它们类似，或者我们的投资与它们相似。而是因为这类基金代表了专业、高薪的投资管理行业的公开平均水平，这些机构管理着规模高达 200 亿美元的证券资产。我认为，这类投资管理机构的表现，代表了管理规模更大资金的机构的普遍水平。我认为可以合理假设，许多合伙人如果不投资我们的合伙公司，可能会选择将资金交给投资方式类似的机构管理。

_Asset Values:_

_资产价值_

The above calculations of results are before allocation to the General Partner and monthly payments to partners. Of course, whenever the overall results for the year are not plus 6% on a market value basis (with deficiencies carried forward) there is no allocation to the General Partner. Therefore,  non-withdrawing partners have had a decrease in their market value equity during the first six months of 7.5% and partners who have withdrawn at the rate of 6% per annum have had a decrease in their market value equity during the first half of 10.5%. Should our results for the year be less than plus 6% (and unless there should be a material advance in the Dow, this is very probable) partners receiving monthly payments will have a decrease in their market value equity at December 31, 1962. This means that monthly payments at 6% on this new market equity next year will be on a proportionately reduced basis. For example, if our results were an overall minus 7% for the year, a partner receiving monthly payments who had a market value interest of $100,000 on January 1, 1962 would have an equity at December 31, 1962 of $87,000. This reduction would arise from the minus 7% result, or $7, 000 plus monthly payments of $500 for an additional $6,000. Thus, with $87,000 of market equity on January 1, 1963, monthly payments next year would be $435.00. 

上述业绩计算是在向普通合伙人分配收益和向合伙人每月支付款项之前进行的。当然，只要某一年按市值计算的总体业绩未达到 6%（不足部分会结转至下一年），普通合伙人就不会获得分配。因此，在 1962 年上半年，未提款的合伙人其市值权益下降了 7.5%，而按每年 6% 的比例提款的合伙人，其市值权益在上半年下降了 10.5%。如果我们全年的业绩低于 6%（除非道琼斯指数大幅上涨，否则这种可能性很大），那么每月领取款项的合伙人在 1962 年 12 月 31 日的市值权益将会减少。这意味着，明年按这一新市值权益的 6% 进行的月度支付将相应减少。例如，如果我们全年的业绩为负 7%，一位在 1962 年 1 月 1 日市值权益为 10 万美元、每月领取款项的合伙人，到 1962 年 12 月 31 日时，其权益将变为 8.7 万美元。这一减少是由于负 7% 的业绩（即 7000 美元）加上每月 500 美元、总计 6000 美元的提款。因此，1963 年 1 月 1 日市值权益为 8.7 万美元时，明年每月的支付金额将为 435 美元。

None of the above, of course, has any applicability to advance payments received during 1962 which do not participate in profits or losses, but earn a straight 6%.

当然，上述情况不适用于 1962 年收到的预付款项，这些款项不参与利润或亏损分配，仅按 6% 的固定利率赚取收益。

_TO MY PARTNERS FOR 1963:_

_致 1963 年合伙人_

Here we go on the annual paper flurry. Two copies of an amended partnership agreement for 1963 are enclosed. The one with the General Provisions attached is to be kept by you and the other single-page agreement should be returned. There are no substantive changes of any sort from last year's agreement. This amendment is merely to allow for a few new partners and in several places to reword in clearer (we hope) language provisions of the present agreement. Practically all of the rewording is in General Provision 5 (paragraph 7 in last year's agreement). Rather than have a separate amending document, we have incorporated the changes into one complete document embodying the entire agreement.

又到了一年一度文件纷飞的时候。随信附上两份 1963 年修订后的合伙协议。附有一般条款的那份由你留存，另一份单页协议请寄回。与去年的协议相比，没有实质性的变化。此次修订仅是为了接纳几位新合伙人，并在一些地方用更清晰（我们希望如此）的语言重新表述现有协议的条款。实际上，大部分的措辞修改都在一般条款 5（去年协议的第 7 段）。为了避免单独的修订文件，我们将修改内容整合到了一份完整的协议文件中。

We are also enclosing two commitment letters (one for you--one to be returned) on which you are to indicate your wishes regarding additions or withdrawals at January 1st. We would like to have the agreement and the commitment letter back by December 1st. However, the commitment letter can be amended right up until the end of the year (not after) so if you should have a change of plans and you have already mailed us your commitment letter, all you have to do is get in touch with me, and I will make whatever changes you desire. 

我们还附上了两份承诺书（一份给你留存，一份请寄回），你需要在上面注明 1 月 1 日时追加或撤回投资的意向。希望你能在 12 月 1 日前寄回协议和承诺书。不过，承诺书在年底前（不能超过年底）都可以修改。所以，如果你改变了计划，且已经把承诺书寄给我们，只需与我联系，我会按你的要求进行修改。

Any withdrawals will be paid immediately after January 1st. Any additions must reach us by January 10th, and should they be paid in during November, they will take on the status of advance payments and draw interest at the rate of 6% until yearend.

任何撤回的投资将在 1 月 1 日后立即支付。任何追加投资必须在 1 月 10 日前到账，如果在 11 月支付，将作为预付款处理，年底前按 6% 的利率计息。

Please be sure the signature on your partnership agreement is notarized. Partners in Omaha may obtain the notarization at our office if they wish. Also, be sure to let us know by an appropriate circle on the commitment letter whether you wish to receive monthly payments in 1963. In order to be sure everyone understands this, let me again state that these monthly payments are in no sense guaranteed earnings or anything of the sort. They represent a convenient form of regular withdrawal, which to the extent we earn better than 6% are payments from earnings, and to the extent we don't, are payments from capital. 

请确保你在合伙协议上的签名经过公证。奥马哈的合伙人如果愿意，可以在我们办公室进行公证。另外，请在承诺书上相应的位置圈选，告知我们你是否希望在 1963 年每月领取款项。为确保大家都理解这一点，我再次说明，这些月度支付款项绝非保证收益或类似的东西。它们只是一种方便的定期提款方式，如果我们的年收益超过 6%，这些款项来自收益；如果未达到 6%，则部分或全部来自本金。

Complete tax information for your 1962 return will be in your hands by January 20th. If you should need an estimate of your tax position before that time, let me know and I will give you a rough idea. We will also send out a short letter on taxes in late December.

1962 年纳税申报所需的完整税务信息将在 1 月 20 日前送达你手中。如果你在此之前需要预估纳税情况，请告知我，我会给你一个大致的估算。12 月下旬我们还会寄出一封关于税务的简短信件。

Having read this far, you are entitled to a report on how we have done to date in 1962. For the periodending October 31st, the Dow-Jones Industrials showed an overall loss, including dividends received, of approximately 16.8%. We intend to use the same method or valuing our controlling interest in Dempster Mill Manufacturing at this yearend that we did at the end of last year. This involved applying various discounts to the balance sheet items to reflect my opinion as to what could be realized on a very prompt sale. Last year this involved a 40% discount on inventories, a 15% discount on receivables, estimated auction value of fixed assets, etc., which led to an approximate value or $35.00 per share.

读到这里，你有权了解我们 1962 年至今的业绩情况。截至 10 月 31 日，道琼斯工业指数包括股息在内的总体损失约为 16.8%。今年年底，我们打算沿用去年年底评估邓普斯特磨坊制造公司控股权的方法。当时，我对资产负债表上的各项资产进行了不同程度的折扣，以反映我对快速出售时可实现价值的判断。去年，存货按 40% 折扣，应收账款按 15% 折扣，固定资产按预估拍卖价值计算，最终得出每股价值约为 35 美元。

The successful conversion of substantial portions of the assets of Dempster to cash, at virtually 100 cents on the dollar, has been the high point of 1962. For example, inventory of $4.2 million at last yearend will probably be about $1.9 million this yearend, reducing the discount on this item by about $920,000 (40% of $2.3 million reduction). I will give this story my full journalistic treatment in my annual letter. Suffice to say at this point that applying the same discounts described above will probably result in a yearend value of at least $50.00 per share. The extent of the asset conversion job can perhaps best be illustrated in a sentence by pointing out that whereas we had $166,000 of cash and $2,315,000 of liabilities at November 30, 1961 (Dempster fiscal yearend), we expect this year to have about $1 million in cash and investments (of the type the Partnership buys) against total liabilities of $250,000. Prospects for further improvement in this situation in 1963 appear good, and we expect a substantially expanded investment portfolio in Dempster next year. 

1962 年的亮点是成功将邓普斯特的大量资产变现，几乎实现了全额价值。例如，去年年底 420 万美元的存货，今年年底可能降至 190 万美元左右，这使得该项资产的折扣减少了约 92 万美元（存货减少 230 万美元的 40%）。在年度信件中，我会详细讲述这个故事。目前可以说，按照上述同样的折扣方法计算，今年年底每股价值可能至少为 50 美元。资产变现工作的成效可以用一句话说明：1961 年 11 月 30 日（邓普斯特财年结束日），我们持有 16.6 万美元现金，负债 231.5 万美元；预计今年我们将持有约 100 万美元现金和投资（与合伙公司投资类型相同），而总负债仅 25 万美元。1963 年这种情况进一步改善的前景良好，我们预计明年邓普斯特的投资组合规模将大幅扩大。

Valuing Dempster at $50 per share, our overall gain (before any payments to partners) to October 31st for the Partnership has been 5.5%. This 22.3 percentage-points advantage over the Dow, if maintained until the end of the year, will be among the largest we have ever had. About 60% of this advantage was accomplished by the portfolio other than Dempster, and 40% was the result of increased value at Dempster.

将邓普斯特的股票估值为每股 50 美元，截至 10 月 31 日，合伙公司总体收益（在向合伙人支付任何款项之前）为 5.5% 。如果到年底我们仍能保持比道琼斯指数高 22.3 个百分点的优势，这将是我们有史以来最大的优势之一。这一优势约 60% 来自邓普斯特以外的投资组合，40% 来自邓普斯特的价值增长。

I want all partners and prospective partners to realize the results described above are distinctly abnormal and will recur infrequently, if at all. This performance is mainly the result of having a large portion of our money in controlled assets and workout situations rather than general market situations at a time when the Dow declined substantially. If the Dow had advanced materially in 1962, we could have looked very bad on a relative basis, and our success to date in 1962 certainly does not reflect any ability on my part to guess the market (I never try), but merely reflects the fact that the high prices of generals partially forced me into other categories or investment. If the Dow had continued to soar, we would have been low man on the totem pole. We fully expect to have years when our method of operation will not even match the results of the Dow, although obviously I don't expect this on any long-term basis or I would throw in the towel and buy the Dow.

我希望所有合伙人及潜在合伙人明白，上述业绩极为反常，即便出现，也不会频繁。这样的业绩主要是因为在道琼斯指数大幅下跌时，我们的大量资金投资于控股资产和特殊投资机会，而非普通市场投资。如果 1962 年道琼斯指数大幅上涨，我们的相对表现可能会很糟糕。我们在 1962 年至今的成功，并不代表我有预测市场的能力（我从不尝试预测市场），只是因为普通股的高价迫使我转向其他投资类别。如果道琼斯指数继续飙升，我们可能会表现垫底。我们完全预料到，在某些年份，我们的投资方式甚至无法跑赢道琼斯指数，不过显然我不认为长期会如此，否则我就会放弃，转而投资道琼斯指数相关产品。

I’ll cut this sermon short with the conclusion that I certainly do not want anyone to think that the pattern of the last few years is likely to be repeated; I expect future performance to reflect much smaller advantages on average over the Dow.

我不再赘述，只想强调，我不希望任何人认为过去几年的模式会重演；我预计未来我们的业绩平均优势会比道琼斯指数小得多。

_The Ground Rules_

_基本原则_

Some partners have confessed (that's the proper word) that they sometimes find it difficult to wade through my entire annual letter. Since I seem to be getting more long-winded each year, I have decided to emphasize certain axioms on the first pages. Everyone should be entirely clear on these points. To most of you this material will seem unduly repetitious, but I would rather have nine partners out of ten mildly bored than have one out of ten with any basic misconceptions.

一些合伙人坦言（这个词很恰当），有时他们觉得很难读完我的年度信件全文。鉴于我似乎一年比一年啰嗦，我决定在开头几页强调一些基本原则。每个人都应该清楚这些要点。对你们大多数人来说，这些内容可能显得过于重复，但我宁愿让十分之九的合伙人稍感厌烦，也不愿让十分之一的人存在基本误解。

1. In no sense is any rate of return guaranteed to partners. Partners who withdraw one-half of 1% monthly are doing just that--withdrawing. If we earn more than 6% per annum over a period of years, the withdrawals will be covered by earnings and the principal will increase. If we don't earn 6%, the monthly payments are partially or wholly a return of capital. 

我们绝不向合伙人保证任何收益率。每月提取 0.5% 资金的合伙人，只是在提款。如果多年来我们的年收益率超过 6%，提款将从收益中支出，本金也会增加。如果收益率未达 6%，每月支付的款项则部分或全部来自本金。

2. Any year in which we fail to achieve at least a plus 6% performance will be followed by a year when partners receiving monthly payments will find those payments lowered. 

任何一年，只要我们的业绩未能至少达到 6% 的正收益，接下来一年，每月领取款项的合伙人会发现领取金额降低。

3. Whenever we talk of yearly gains or losses, we are talking about market values; that is, how we stand with assets valued at market at yearend against how we stood on the same basis at the beginning of the year. This may bear very little relationship to the realized results for tax purposes in a given year. 

我们所说的年度盈亏，都是按市值计算的，即年末资产市值与年初同口径市值的比较。这与特定年份纳税申报时的实际收益可能相差甚远。

4. Whether we do a good job or a poor job is not to be measured by whether we are plus or minus for the year. It is instead to be measured against the general experience in securities as measured by the Dow-Jones Industrial Average, leading investment companies, etc. If our record is better than that of these yardsticks, we consider it a good year whether we are plus or minus. If we do poorer, we deserve the tomatoes.

判断我们工作好坏，不是看当年收益是正还是负，而是与道琼斯工业平均指数、主要投资公司等衡量的证券市场总体表现相比。如果我们的业绩优于这些基准，无论当年收益正负，我们都认为是好年份。反之，我们就该接受批评。

5. While I much prefer a five-year test, I feel three years is an absolute minimum for judging performance. It is a certainty that we will have years when the partnership performance is poorer, perhaps substantially so, than the Dow. If any three-year or longer period produces poor results, we all should start looking around for other places to have our money. An exception to the latter statement would be three years covering a speculative explosion in a bull market. 

虽然我更倾向于用五年时间来评估业绩，但我认为三年是评判业绩的最短期限。可以肯定的是，我们会有业绩比道琼斯指数差的年份，甚至可能差距很大。如果任何三年或更长时间的业绩都很差，我们都应该考虑把钱投到其他地方。不过，如果这三年处于牛市投机热潮期，则属例外。

6. I am not in the business of predicting general stock market or business fluctuations. If you think I can do this, or think it is essential to an investment program, you should not be in the partnership.

我不会预测股市大盘或商业波动。如果你认为我能做到，或者认为这对投资至关重要，那你就不应该加入合伙公司。

7. I cannot promise results to partners. What I can and do promise is that: 

我无法向合伙人承诺业绩，但我可以并确实承诺：

   1. Our investments will be chosen on the basis of value, not popularity; 

    我们选择投资基于价值，而非市场热度；

   2. That we will attempt to bring risk of permanent capital loss (not short-term quotational loss) to an absolute minimum by obtaining a wide margin of safety in each commitment and a diversity of commitments; and

    我们会通过在每项投资中获取足够的安全边际和分散投资，将永久资本损失（而非短期股价波动损失）的风险降至最低；

   3. My wife, children and I will have virtually our entire net worth invested in the partnership.

    我的妻子、孩子和我几乎将全部净资产都投入了合伙公司。

_Our Performance in 1962_

_1962 年业绩_

I have consistently told partners that we expect to shine on a relative basis during minus years for the Dow, whereas plus years of any magnitude may find us blushing. This held true in 1962.

我一直告诉合伙人，当道琼斯指数下跌时，我们的相对表现有望出色；而在道琼斯指数大幅上涨的年份，我们可能表现欠佳。1962 年正是如此。

Because of a strong rally in the last few months, the general market as measured by the Dow really did not have such a frightening decline as many might think. From 731 at the beginning of the year, it dipped to 535 in June, but closed at 652. At the end of 1960, the Dow stood at 616, so you can see that while there has been a good deal of action the past few years, the investing public as a whole is not too far from where it was in 1959 or 1960. If one had owned the Dow last year (and I imagine there are a few people playing the high flyers of 1961 who wish they had), they would have had a shrinkage in market value of 79.04 or 10.8%. However, dividends of approximately 23.30 would have been received to bring the overall results from the Dow for the year to minus 7.6%. Our own overall record was plus 13.9%. Below we show the year-by-year performance of the Dow, the partnership before allocation to the general partner, and the limited partners' results for all full years of Buffett Partnership, Ltd.'s and predecessor partnerships' activities:

由于过去几个月市场强劲反弹，以道琼斯指数衡量的大盘跌幅并没有很多人想象的那么可怕。从年初的 731 点跌至 6 月的 535 点，但年末收于 652 点。1960 年底，道琼斯指数为 616 点，所以可以看出，尽管过去几年市场波动较大，但总体而言，投资者的状况与 1959 年或 1960 年相比并没有太大变化。如果有人去年持有道琼斯指数成分股（我想，那些在 1961 年追逐热门股的人现在可能希望自己当初持有了），其市值会缩水 79.04 点，跌幅为 10.8% 。不过，大约 23.30 美元的股息会使道琼斯指数当年的总体收益变为负 7.6% 。我们的总体业绩为正 13.9% 。以下展示道琼斯指数、合伙公司（向普通合伙人分配前）以及巴菲特合伙有限公司和前期合伙公司所有完整年度有限合伙人的逐年业绩：

The following table shows the cumulative or compounded results in the same three categories, as well as the average annual compounded rate:

下表展示了上述三类业绩的累积或复合结果，以及平均年复合增长率：

| Year |  Overall Results from Dow | Partnership Results | Limited Partners Results |
| 年份 |  道琼斯指数总体收益 | 合伙公司业绩 | 有限合伙人业绩 |
| 1957 |  -8.4% | 10.4% | 9.3% | 
| 1957-58 | 26.9% | 55.6% | 44.5% | 
| 1957-59 | 52.3% | 95.9% | 74.7% | 
| 1957-60 | 42.9% | 140.6% | 107.2% | 
| 1957-61 | 74.9% | 251.0% | 181.6% | 
| 1957-62 | 61.6% | 299.8% | 215.1% | 
| Annual Compounded Rate 平均年复合增长率 | 8.3% | 26.0% | 21.1% |

My (unscientific) opinion is that a margin of ten percentage points per annum over the Dow is the very maximum that can be achieved with invested funds over any long period of years, so it may be well to mentally modify some of the above figures.

我（非科学的）观点是，长期来看，每年比道琼斯指数多 10 个百分点的收益是投资资金所能达到的最大优势，所以或许应该对上述部分数据进行适当调整。

Partners have sometimes expressed concern as to the effect of size upon performance. This subject was reflected upon in last year’s annual letter. The conclusion reached was that there were some situations where larger sums helped and some where they hindered, but on balance, I did not feel they would penalize performance. I promised to inform partners if my conclusions on this should change. At the beginning of 1957, combined limited partnership assets totaled $303,726 and grew to $7,178,500 at the beginning or 1962. To date, anyway, our margin over the Dow has indicated no tendency to narrow as funds increase.

合伙人有时会担心公司规模对业绩的影响。去年的年度信件讨论过这个问题，结论是在某些情况下，资金规模较大有帮助，而在另一些情况下则会有阻碍，但总体而言，我认为规模不会对业绩产生负面影响。我承诺过，如果我在这方面的结论发生变化，会告知合伙人。1957 年初，有限合伙公司的总资产为 303,726 美元，到 1962 年初增长至 7,178,500 美元。至少到目前为止，随着资金增加，我们与道琼斯指数的业绩优势并没有缩小的趋势。

_Investment Companies_

_投资公司_

Along with the results of the Dow, we have regularly included the tabulations on the two largest open-end investment companies (mutual funds) following a common stock policy, and the two largest diversified closed end investment companies. These four companies, Massachusetts Investors Trust, Investors Stock Fund, Tri Continental Corp. and Lehman Corp. manage over $3 billion and are probably typical of most of the $20 billion investment company industry. My opinion is that their results parallel those of most bank trust departments and investment counseling organizations which handle, in aggregate, vastly greater sums.

除了道琼斯指数的业绩，我们还定期列出两家奉行普通股投资策略的最大开放式投资公司（共同基金）以及两家最大的多元化封闭式投资公司的业绩数据。这四家公司，即马萨诸塞投资者信托、投资者股票基金、三角大陆公司和雷曼公司，管理着超过 30 亿美元的资产，可能代表了规模达 200 亿美元的投资公司行业的大多数情况。我认为，它们的业绩与大多数银行信托部门和投资咨询机构类似，而这些机构管理的资金总额要大得多。

The purpose of this tabulation, which is shown below, is to illustrate that the Dow is no pushover as an index of investment achievement. The advisory talent managing just the four companies shown commands annual fees of approximately $7 million and this represents a very small fraction of the industry. Nevertheless, the public batting average of this highly-paid talent indicates results slightly less favorable than the Dow. In no sense is this statement intended as criticism. Within their institutional framework and handling the many billions of dollars involved, I consider such average results virtually the only possible ones. Their merits lie in other than superior results.

以下列出这些数据，是为了说明道琼斯指数并非轻易就能超越的投资业绩指标。仅管理这四家公司的投资顾问团队，每年收取的费用就约 700 万美元，这只是整个行业费用的一小部分。然而，这些高薪专业人士的公开平均业绩却略逊于道琼斯指数。我这样说并非批评，在他们的机构框架内，管理着巨额资金，取得这样的平均业绩几乎是必然的。他们的优势并不在于卓越的业绩表现。

Both our portfolio and method of operation differ substantially from the companies mentioned above. However, most partners, as an alternative to their interest in the partnership would probably have their funds invested in media producing results comparable with investment companies, and I, therefore feel they offer a meaningful test of performance.

我们的投资组合和运营方式与上述公司有很大差异。不过，大多数合伙人如果不投资我们的合伙公司，很可能会将资金投入业绩与投资公司相当的机构，因此我认为这些公司的业绩是衡量我们表现的有效参照。

_The Joys of Compounding_

_复合增长的魔力_

I have it from unreliable sources that the cost of the voyage Isabella originally underwrote for Columbus was approximately $30,000. This has been considered at least a moderately successful utilization of venture capital. Without attempting to evaluate the psychic income derived from finding a new hemisphere, it must be pointed out that even had squatter's rights prevailed, the whole deal was not exactly another IBM. Figured very roughly, the $30,000 invested at 4% compounded annually would have amounted to something like $2,000,000,000,000 (that's $2 trillion for those of you who are not government statisticians) by 1962. Historical apologists for the Indians of Manhattan may find refuge in similar calculations. Such fanciful geometric progressions illustrate the value of either living a long time, or compounding your money at a decent rate. I have nothing particularly helpful to say on the former point.

我从不可靠的渠道得知，伊莎贝拉最初资助哥伦布航海的费用约为 3 万美元。这至少被认为是对风险资本较为成功的运用。暂且不评估发现新大陆带来的精神收益，必须指出的是，即便按照 “先占先得” 的原则，这次投资也远不及投资 IBM。粗略计算一下，如果这 3 万美元以每年 4% 的复利投资，到 1962 年大约会增值到 2 万亿美元（如果不是政府统计人员，可能对这个数字没概念）。为曼哈顿印第安人进行历史辩护的人，或许能从类似计算中找到慰藉。这些夸张的几何级数增长，说明了长寿或者以合理利率进行复利投资的价值。关于前者，我没什么有用的建议。

The following table indicates the compounded value of $100,000 at 5%, 10% and 15% for 10, 20 and 30 years. It is always startling to see how relatively small differences in rates add up to very significant sums over a period of years. That is why, even though we are shooting for more, we feel that a few percentage points advantage over the Dow is a very worthwhile achievement. It can mean a lot of dollars over a decade or two.

下表展示了 10 万美元分别按 5%、10% 和 15% 的利率，投资 10 年、20 年和 30 年的复利价值。多年来，利率上相对较小的差异能累积成巨大的金额，总是令人惊讶。这就是为什么，尽管我们追求更高的收益，但仍认为比道琼斯指数多几个百分点的优势是非常了不起的成就。在一二十年的时间里，这可能意味着巨额财富。

| 期限 | 5% | 10% | 15% |
| 10 Years | $162,889 | $259,374 | $404,553 |
| 20 Years | $265,328 | $672,748 | $1,636,640 |
| 30 Years | $432,191 | $1,744,930 | $6,621,140 |

_Our Method of Operation_

_我们的投资方式_

Our avenues of investment break down into three categories. These categories have different behavior characteristics, and the way our money is divided among them will have an important effect on our results, relative to the Dow, in any given year. The actual percentage division among categories is to some degree planned, but to a great extent, accidental, based upon availability factors.

我们的投资渠道分为三类。这三类投资具有不同的表现特征，在任何一年，资金在它们之间的分配方式都会对我们相对于道琼斯指数的业绩产生重要影响。各类投资的实际占比在一定程度上是预先规划的，但很大程度上也受投资机会的影响，具有偶然性。

The first section consists of generally undervalued securities (hereinafter called “generals”) where we have nothing to say about corporate policies and no timetable as to when the undervaluation may correct itself .Over the years, this has been our largest category of investment, and more money has been made here than in either of the other categories. We usually have fairly large positions (5% to 10% of our total assets) in each of five or six generals, with smaller positions in another ten or fifteen.

第一类是普遍被低估的证券（以下简称 “普通股”），对于这类投资，我们无法影响公司决策，也无法确定其估值何时会恢复正常。多年来，这一直是我们最大的投资类别，从中获得的收益比其他两类都多。我们通常会在五六只普通股上持有较大仓位（占总资产的 5% 至 10%），另外还会在十到十五只普通股上持有较小仓位。

Sometimes these work out very fast; many times they take years. It is difficult at the time of purchase to know any compelling reason why they should appreciate in price. However, because of this lack of glamour or anything pending which might create immediate favorable market action, they are available at very cheap prices. A lot of value can be obtained for the price paid. This substantial excess of value creates a comfortable margin of safety in each transaction. Combining this individual margin of safety with a diversity of commitments creates a most attractive package of safety and appreciation potential. We do not go into these generals with the idea of getting the last nickel, but are usually quite content selling out at some intermediate level between our purchase price and what we regard as fair value to a private owner.

有时这些投资很快就能获利；但很多时候，需要数年时间。在买入时，很难找到它们价格上涨的充分理由。然而，正是因为缺乏吸引力，也没有能立即推动市场上涨的因素，它们的价格才非常低廉。投资者能以较低价格获得很高的价值。这种价值的大幅溢价为每笔交易提供了安全边际。将这种单个投资的安全边际与多元化投资相结合，就构成了一个极具吸引力的投资组合，兼具安全性和增值潜力。我们投资普通股时，并不期望赚取最后一分钱，通常在买入价和我们认为的私人所有者眼中的公允价值之间的某个中间价位卖出，就会感到很满足。

Many times generals represent a form of "coattail riding" where we feel the dominating stockholder group has plans for the conversion of unprofitable or under-utilized assets to a better use. We have done that ourselves in Sanborn and Dempster, but everything else equal we would rather let others do the work. Obviously, not only do the values have to be ample in a case like this, but we also have to be careful whose coat we are holding. 

很多时候，投资普通股就像是 “搭便车”，我们认为控股股东有计划将无利可图或未充分利用的资产转化为更有效的用途。我们在桑伯恩地图公司（Sanborn）和邓普斯特公司都这么做过，但在其他条件相同的情况下，我们更愿意让别人去做这些工作。显然，在这种情况下，不仅资产价值要足够高，我们还得谨慎选择 “搭谁的便车”。

The generals tend to behave market-wise very much in sympathy with the Dow. Just because something is cheap does not mean it is not going to go down. During abrupt downward movements in the market, this segment may very well go down percentage-wise just as much as the Dow. Over a period of years, I believe the generals will outperform the Dow, and during sharply advancing years like 1961. This is the section of our portfolio that turns in the best results. It is, of course, also the most vulnerable in a declining market, and in 1962, not only did we not make any money out of our general category, but I am even doubtful if it did better than the Dow.

普通股在市场表现上往往与道琼斯指数高度相关。仅仅因为某只股票价格便宜，并不意味着它不会下跌。在市场突然下跌时，这类投资的跌幅很可能与道琼斯指数相当。但从长期来看，我相信普通股的表现会优于道琼斯指数，比如在 1961 年这样的大幅上涨年份。在我们的投资组合中，普通股在这类年份的表现最佳。当然，在市场下跌时，它也是最脆弱的。1962 年，我们不仅在普通股投资上没有盈利，我甚至怀疑其表现是否优于道琼斯指数。

Our second category consists of "work-outs. These are securities whose financial results depend on corporate action rather than supply and demand factors created by buyers and sellers of securities. In other words, they are securities with a timetable where we can predict, within reasonable error limits, when we will get how much and what might upset the applecart. Corporate events such as mergers, liquidations, reorganizations, spin-offs, etc., I lead to work-outs. An important source in recent years has been sell-outs by oil producers to major integrated oil companies.

第二类是 “特殊情况投资”。这类证券的财务回报取决于公司行为，而非证券买卖双方创造的供求因素。换句话说，这类投资有明确的时间表，我们能在合理误差范围内预测何时能获得多少收益，以及可能出现哪些影响因素。公司的合并、清算、重组、分拆等事件都能带来特殊情况投资机会。近年来，一个重要的投资机会来源是石油生产商向大型综合石油公司的出售交易。

This category will produce reasonably stable earnings from year to year, to a large extent irrespective of the course of the Dow. Obviously, if we operate throughout a year with a large portion of our portfolio in work-outs, we will look extremely good if it turns out to be a declining year for the Dow, or quite bad if it is a strongly advancing year.

这类投资每年能产生相对稳定的收益，在很大程度上不受道琼斯指数走势的影响。显然，如果我们在某一年将大部分投资组合投入特殊情况投资，当道琼斯指数下跌时，我们的表现会非常出色；但如果市场大幅上涨，我们的表现可能会很差。

We were fortunate in that we had a good portion of our portfolio in work outs in 1962. As I have said before, this was not due to any notion on my part as to what the market would do, but rather because I could get more of what I wanted in this category than in the generals. This same concentration in work-outs hurt our performance during the market advance in the second half of the year.

1962 年，我们很幸运，投资组合中有很大一部分是特殊情况投资。我之前说过，这并非因为我对市场走势有先见之明，而是因为在这类投资中，我能找到更多符合要求的机会，比普通股投资机会更多。同样是因为这类投资过于集中，在下半年市场上涨时，我们的业绩受到了影响。

Over the years, work-outs have provided our second largest category. At any given time, we may be in five to ten of these; some just beginning and others in the late stage of their development. I believe in using borrowed money to offset a portion of our work-out portfolio, since there is a high degree of safety in this category in terms of both eventual results and intermediate market behavior. For instance, you will note when you receive our audit report, that we paid $75,000 of interest to banks and brokers during the year. Since our borrowing was at approximately 5%, this means we had an average of $1,500,000 borrowed from such sources. Since 1962 was a down year in the market, you might think that such borrowing would hurt results. However, all of our loans were to offset work-outs, and this category turned in a good profit for the year. Results, excluding the benefits derived from the use of borrowed money, usually fall in the 10% to 20% per annum range. My self-imposed standard limit regarding borrowing is 25% of partnership net worth, although something extraordinary could result in modifying this for a limited period of time.

多年来，特殊情况投资一直是我们的第二大投资类别。在任何时候，我们可能同时参与五到十个这类项目，有些刚刚开始，有些则已进入后期阶段。我认为可以用借款来对冲部分特殊情况投资组合，因为从最终结果和中期市场表现来看，这类投资的安全性很高。比如，当你收到审计报告时会发现，我们当年向银行和经纪商支付了 7.5 万美元利息。由于我们的借款利率约为 5%，这意味着我们平均从这些渠道借款 150 万美元。由于 1962 年是市场下跌年份，你可能认为借款会影响业绩。然而，我们所有借款都是为了对冲特殊情况投资，而这类投资在当年获得了可观的利润。排除借款带来的收益，特殊情况投资的年回报率通常在 10% 至 20% 之间。我给自己设定的借款上限是合伙公司净资产的 25%，不过在特殊情况下，这个限制可能会在短期内调整。

You will note on our yearend balance sheet (part of the audit you will receive) securities sold short totaling some $340,000. Most of this occurred in conjunction with a work-out entered into late in the year. In this case, we had very little competition for a period of time and were able to create a 10% or better profit (gross, not annualized) for a few months tie-up of money. The short sales eliminated the general market risk.

在我们的年终资产负债表（你将收到的审计报告的一部分）上，你会看到卖空证券的总额约为 34 万美元。这主要是在当年年末进行的一项特殊情况投资中产生的。在那段时间里，竞争较少，我们得以通过几个月的资金占用实现 10% 甚至更高的利润（毛利润，未年化）。卖空操作消除了一般市场风险。

The final category is I “control” situations, where we either control the company or take a very large position and attempt to influence policies of the company. Such operations should definitely be measured on the basis of several years. In a given year, they may produce nothing as it is usually to our advantage to have the stock be stagnant market-wise for a long period while we are acquiring it. These situations, too, have relatively little in common with the behavior of the Dow. Sometimes, of course, we buy into a general with the thought in mind that it might develop into a control situation. If the price remains low enough for a long period, this might very well happen. Usually, it moves up before we have a substantial percentage of the company's stock, and we sell at higher levels and complete a successful general operation.

最后一类是 “控股型投资”，即我们要么控制一家公司，要么持有大量股份并试图影响公司政策。这类投资显然应该以数年为周期来衡量。在某一年，它们可能不会产生任何收益，因为在我们收购股份的很长一段时间内，股价保持停滞通常对我们有利。这类投资与道琼斯指数的表现也没有太多关联。当然，有时我们买入一只普通股时，会考虑它是否有可能发展成为控股型投资。如果股价长期保持低位，这种情况很可能发生。但通常在我们获得公司大量股份之前，股价就会上涨，我们会在较高价位卖出，完成一次成功的普通股投资操作。

_Dempster Mill Manufacturing Company_

_邓普斯特制造公司_

The high point of 1962 from a performance standpoint was our present control situation --73% owned Dempster Mill. Dempster has been primarily in farm implements (mostly items retailing for $1,000 or under), water systems, water well supplies and jobbed plumbing lines.

从业绩角度来看，1962 年的亮点是我们目前控股的邓普斯特磨坊制造公司，我们持有其 73% 的股份。邓普斯特主要经营农业机械（大多是零售价在 1000 美元以下的产品）、供水系统、水井设备以及管道产品的批发业务。

The operations for the past decade have been characterized by static sales, low inventory turnover and virtually no profits in relation to invested capital.

过去十年，该公司的经营特点是销售额停滞不前、库存周转率低，相对于投入的资本而言，几乎没有利润。

We obtained control in August, 1961 at an average price of about $28 per share, having bought some stock as low as $16 in earlier years, but the vast majority in an offer of $30.25 in August. When control of a company is obtained, obviously what then becomes all-important is the value of assets, not the market quotation for a piece of paper (stock certificate).

1961 年 8 月，我们以平均每股约 28 美元的价格获得了该公司的控制权，早些年我们曾以低至 16 美元的价格买入部分股票，但大部分股份是以 8 月份每股 30.25 美元的报价购入的。当获得一家公司的控制权后，显然最重要的就是资产的价值，而不是一张纸（股票凭证）的市场报价。

Last year, our Dempster holding was valued by applying what I felt were appropriate discounts to the various assets. These valuations were based on their status as non-earning assets and were not assessed on the basis of potential, but on the basis of what I thought a prompt sale would produce at that date. Our job was to compound these values at a decent rate. The consolidated balance sheet last year and the calculation of fair value are shown below. (000’s omitted)

去年，我们对持有的邓普斯特股票进行估值时，对各项资产进行了我认为合适的折价处理。这些估值是基于资产当时不盈利的状况，并非基于其潜在价值，而是基于我对当时快速出售所能获得价值的判断。我们的任务是以合理的利率使这些价值实现复利增长。以下是去年的合并资产负债表以及公允价值的计算。（单位：千美元，省略）

Dempster's fiscal year ends November 30th, and because the audit was unavailable in complete form, I approximated some of the figures and rounded to $35 per share last year.

邓普斯特的财年截止到 11 月 30 日，由于当时无法获得完整的审计报告，我对部分数据进行了估算，并将每股价值四舍五入到 35 美元。

Initially, we worked with the old management toward more effective utilization of capital, better operating margins, reduction of overhead, etc. These efforts were completely fruitless. After spinning our wheels for about six months, it became obvious that while lip service was being given to our objective, either through inability or unwillingness, nothing was being accomplished. A change was necessary.

起初，我们与原管理层合作，试图更有效地利用资本、提高运营利润率、降低管理费用等。但这些努力完全没有成效。在白费力气约六个月后，很明显，虽然他们口头上认同我们的目标，但由于能力不足或不愿意，没有取得任何实际成果。变革势在必行。

A good friend, whose inclination is not toward enthusiastic descriptions, highly recommended Harry Bottle for our type of problem. On April 17, 1962 I met Harry in Los Angeles, presented a deal which provided for rewards to him based upon our objectives being met, and on April 23rd he was sitting in the president's chair in Beatrice.

一位不太会说溢美之词的好朋友，极力向我推荐哈里・博特尔（Harry Bottle）来解决我们的问题。1962 年 4 月 17 日，我在洛杉矶与哈里见面，提出了一项激励方案，根据目标完成情况给予他相应奖励。4 月 23 日，他就坐上了位于比阿特丽斯的公司总裁的位置。

Harry is unquestionably the man of the year. Every goal we have set for Harry has been met, and all the surprises have been on the pleasant side. He has accomplished one thing after another that has been labeled as impossible, and has always taken the tough things first. Our breakeven point has been cut virtually in half, slow-moving or dead merchandise has been sold or written off, marketing procedures have been revamped, and unprofitable facilities have been sold.

毫无疑问，哈里是年度最佳人物。我们为他设定的每一个目标都实现了，而且所有的结果都超出预期。他完成了一件又一件被认为不可能的事情，总是先从最棘手的问题入手。我们的盈亏平衡点几乎减半，滞销或积压的商品要么被售出，要么被核销，营销流程得到了改进，不盈利的业务也被出售。

The results of this program are partially shown in the balance sheet below, which, since it still represents non-earning assets, is valued on the same basis as last year. (000’s omitted)

以下资产负债表部分展示了这些措施的成果。由于这些资产仍未产生收益，因此估值方法与去年相同。（单位：千美元，省略）

| Total Assets 总资产 | $4,423 |  | $3,471 | Adjusted value per share 	调整后每股价值 | $51.26 | 

Three facts stand out: (1) Although net worth has been reduced somewhat by the housecleaning and writedowns ($550,000 was written out of inventory; fixed assets overall brought more than book value), we have converted assets to cash at a rate far superior to that implied in our year-earlier valuation. (2) To some extent, we have converted the assets from the manufacturing business (which has been a poor business) to a business which we think is a good business --securities. (3) By buying assets at a bargain price, we don't need to pull any rabbits out of a hat to get extremely good percentage gains. This is the cornerstone of our investment philosophy: “Never count on making a good sale. Have the purchase price be so attractive that even a mediocre sale gives good results. The better sales will be the frosting on the cake.”

有三个事实值得关注：第一，尽管通过清理资产和减记（存货减记 55 万美元；固定资产整体售价高于账面价值），净资产有所减少，但我们将资产变现的速度远远超过了去年估值时的预期。第二，在一定程度上，我们将资产从制造业（这是一个表现不佳的行业）转移到了我们认为前景更好的证券投资领域。第三，通过以低价买入资产，我们无需依赖运气就能获得极高的回报率。这是我们投资理念的基石：“永远不要指望通过出色的卖出获利。确保买入价格足够诱人，这样即使是普通的卖出也能带来不错的收益。而出色的卖出则是锦上添花。”

On January 2, 1963, Dempster received an unsecured term loan of $1,250,000. These funds, together with the funds all ready "freed-up" will enable us to have a security portfolio of about $35 per share at Dempster, or considerably more than we paid for the whole company. Thus our present valuation will involve a net of about $16 per share in the manufacturing operation and $35 in a security operation comparable to that of Buffett Partnership, Ltd.

1963 年 1 月 2 日，邓普斯特获得了一笔 125 万美元的无担保定期贷款。这些资金加上已经 “释放” 的资金，将使邓普斯特的证券投资组合价值达到每股约 35 美元，这比我们收购整个公司的成本还要高。因此，我们目前对邓普斯特的估值相当于制造业业务每股净值约 16 美元，以及与巴菲特合伙有限公司类似的证券投资业务每股 35 美元。

We, of course, are devoted to compounding the $16 in manufacturing at an attractive rate and believe we have some good ideas as to how to accomplish this. While this will be easy if the business as presently conducted earns money, we have some promising ideas even if it shouldn't.

当然，我们致力于以有吸引力的利率使制造业业务的 16 美元实现复利增长，并且相信我们有一些可行的方案来实现这一目标。如果目前的业务能够盈利，这将很容易实现；即便业务不盈利，我们也有一些颇具前景的想法。

It should be pointed out that Dempster last year was 100% an asset conversion problem and therefore, completely unaffected by the stock market and tremendously affected by our success with the assets. In 1963, the manufacturing assets will still be important, but from a valuation standpoint it will behave considerably more like a general since we will have a large portion of its money invested in generals pretty much identical with those in Buffett Partnership, Ltd. For tax reasons, we will probably not put workouts in Dempster. Therefore, if the Dow should drop substantially, it would have a significant effect on the Dempster valuation. Likewise, Dempster would benefit this year from an advancing Dow which would not have been the case most of last year.

需要指出的是，去年邓普斯特完全是一个资产转换问题，因此完全不受股市影响，而极大地受我们资产运作成功与否的影响。1963 年，制造业资产仍然重要，但从估值角度来看，它的表现将更像一只普通股，因为我们会将其大部分资金投资于与巴菲特合伙有限公司类似的普通股。出于税务方面的考虑，我们可能不会在邓普斯特进行特殊情况投资。因此，如果道琼斯指数大幅下跌，将会对邓普斯特的估值产生重大影响。同样，今年如果道琼斯指数上涨，邓普斯特也将受益，而去年大部分时间并非如此。

There is one final point of real significance for Buffett Partnership, Ltd. We now have a relationship with an operating man which could be of great benefit in future control situations. Harry had never thought of running an implement company six days before he took over. He is mobile, hardworking and carries out policies once they are set. He likes to get paid well for doing well, and I like dealing with someone who is not trying to figure how to get the fixtures in the executive washroom gold-plated.

对于巴菲特合伙有限公司而言，还有一点非常重要。我们现在与一位运营人才建立了良好的关系，这在未来的控股型投资中可能会带来巨大的好处。在接管邓普斯特之前，哈里从未想过要经营一家农机公司。他行动敏捷、勤奋努力，一旦制定了政策就会坚决执行。他希望因出色的工作获得丰厚的回报，而我也喜欢与那些不会想着给高管洗手间的固定装置镀金的人打交道。

Harry and I like each other, and his relationship with Buffett Partnership, Ltd. should be profitable for all of us.

哈里和我彼此欣赏，他与巴菲特合伙有限公司的合作关系对我们所有人来说都应该是有利可图的。

_The Question of Conservatism_

_保守投资的问题_

Because I believe it may be even more meaningful after the events of 1962 I would like to repeat this section from last year’s letter:

鉴于 1962 年的市场情况，我认为重复去年信件中的这部分内容可能更有意义：

"The above description of our various areas of operation may provide some clues as to how conservatively our portfolio is invested. Many people some years back thought they were behaving in the most conservative manner by purchasing medium or long-term municipal or government bonds. This policy has produced substantial market depreciation in many cases, and most certainly has failed to maintain or increase real buying power.

“上述对我们各类投资领域的描述，或许能让你了解我们投资组合的保守程度。多年前，许多人认为购买中期或长期市政债券或政府债券是最保守的投资方式。但在很多情况下，这种策略导致了大幅的市场价值贬值，而且肯定无法维持或增加实际购买力。

"Conscious, perhaps overly conscious, of inflation, many people now feel that they are behaving in a conservative manner by buying blue chip securities almost regardless of price-earnings ratios, dividend yields, etc. Without the benefit of hindsight as in the bond example, I feel this course of action is fraught with danger. There is nothing at all conservative, in my opinion, about speculating as to just how high a multiplier a greedy and capricious public will put on earnings.

由于意识到（或许是过度意识到）通货膨胀，现在许多人认为，几乎不考虑市盈率、股息率等因素购买蓝筹股就是保守投资。与债券投资的例子不同，由于无法事后诸葛亮，我认为这种投资方式充满风险。在我看来，猜测贪婪且反复无常的公众会给收益赋予多高的估值乘数，根本算不上保守投资。

You will not be right simply because a large number of people momentarily agree with you. You will not be right simply because important people agree with you. In many quarters the simultaneous occurrence of the two above factors is enough to make a course of action meet the test of conservatism. “You will be right, over the course of many transactions, if your hypotheses are correct, your facts are correct, and your reasoning is correct. True conservatism is only possible through knowledge and reason.

仅仅因为很多人一时认同你的观点，并不意味着你就是正确的。仅仅因为重要人物认同你，也不意味着你就是正确的。在很多情况下，上述两个因素同时出现，就足以让一种投资行为被视为保守投资。但实际上，在众多交易中，只有当你的假设正确、事实准确、推理合理时，你才会是正确的。真正的保守投资只有通过知识和理性才能实现。”

I might add that in no way does the fact that our portfolio is not conventional prove that we are more conservative or less conservative than standard methods of investing. This can only be determined by examining the methods or examining the results.

我还想补充一点，我们的投资组合不符合常规，这并不能证明我们比传统投资方式更保守或更不保守。这只能通过研究投资方法或评估投资结果来判断。

I feel the most objective test as to just how conservative our manner of investing is arises through evaluation of performance in down markets. Preferably these should involve a substantial decline in the Dow. Our performance in the rather mild declines of 1957 and 1960 would confirm my hypothesis that we invest in an extremely conservative manner. I would welcome any partner's suggesting objective tests as to conservatism to see how we stack up. We have never suffered a realized loss of more than ½ of 1% of total net assets and our ratio of total dollars of realized gains to total realized losses is something like 100 to 1. Of course, this reflects the fact that on balance we have been operating in an up market. However there have been many opportunities for loss transactions even in markets such as these (you may have found out about a few of these yourselves) so I think the above facts have some significance.

我认为，评估我们投资方式保守程度的最客观标准，是看市场下跌时的业绩表现。最好是道琼斯指数大幅下跌的情况。我们在 1957 年和 1960 年相对温和的市场下跌中的表现，证实了我认为我们投资方式极为保守的观点。我欢迎任何合伙人提出评估保守程度的客观标准，看看我们的表现如何。我们从未遭受过超过总资产净值 0.5% 的实际损失，而且我们的总实现收益与总实现损失之比约为 100 比 1。当然，这反映出总体而言我们是在牛市中运营。然而，即使在这样的市场中，也有很多可能导致亏损的交易机会（你们自己可能也遇到过一些），所以我认为上述事实还是有一定意义的。

In 1962, we did realize a loss on one commitment or 1.0% and our ratio or realized gains to losses was only slightly over 3 to 1. However, compared to more conventional (often termed conservative which is not synonymous) methods of common stock investing, it would appear that our method involved considerably less risk. Our advantage over the Dow was all achieved when the market was going down; we lost a bit of this edge on the way up.

1962 年，我们在一项投资上确实遭受了 1.0% 的损失，实现收益与损失之比仅略高于 3 比 1。不过，与更传统（通常被称为保守，但并不准确）的普通股投资方式相比，我们的投资方式风险似乎要小得多。我们在市场下跌时获得了超越道琼斯指数的优势；在市场上涨过程中，我们的这一优势有所削弱。

_The Usual Prediction_

一如既往的预测

I am certainly not going to predict what general business or the stock market are going to do in the next year or two, since I don't have the faintest idea.

我当然不会预测未来一两年内整体商业形势或股市的走势，因为我完全没有头绪。

I think you can be quite sure that over the next ten years, there are going to be a few years when the general market is plus 20% or 25% a few when it is minus on the same order, and a majority when it is in between. I haven’t any notion as to the sequence in which these will occur, nor do I think it is of any great importance for the long-term investor. If you will take the first table on page 3 and shuffle the years around, the compounded result will stay the same. If the next four years are going to involve, say, a +40%, -30%, +10% and –6%, the order in which they fall is completely unimportant for our purposes as long as we all are around at the end of the four years. Over a long period of years, I think it likely that the Dow will probably produce something like 5% per year compounded from a combination of dividends and market value gain. Despite the experience of the last decade, anyone expecting substantially better than that from the general market probably faces disappointment.

我认为你可以十分确定，在未来十年里，会有几年股市大盘上涨 20% 或 25%，也会有几年下跌相同幅度，而大多数年份涨跌幅度介于两者之间。我不清楚这些情况出现的先后顺序，而且我认为这对长期投资者来说也并非至关重要。如果你把第 3 页的第一张表格中的年份打乱顺序，复合结果不会改变。比如，如果未来四年的市场走势分别是上涨 40%、下跌 30%、上涨 10% 和下跌 6%，只要四年后我们都还在，那么这些涨跌出现的顺序对我们来说完全无关紧要。在任何较长的时间段内，我认为道琼斯指数很可能会通过股息和市值增长的综合作用，实现每年约 5% 的复合增长率。尽管过去十年市场表现有所不同，但任何期望股市大盘表现大幅优于这一水平的人，可能都会失望。

Our job is to pile up yearly advantages over the performance of the Dow without worrying too much about whether the absolute results in a given year are a plus or a minus. I would consider a year in which we were down 15% and the Dow declined 25% to be much superior to a year when both the partnership and the Dow advanced 20%.

我们的工作是每年都要在业绩上超越道琼斯指数，而不必过于担心某一年的绝对业绩是正还是负。我会认为，在我们下跌 15% 而道琼斯指数下跌 25% 的年份，要比我们和道琼斯指数都上涨 20% 的年份好得多。

For the reasons outlined in our method of operation, our best years relative to the Dow are likely to be in declining or static markets. Therefore, the advantage we seek will probably come in sharply varying amounts. There are bound to be years when we are surpassed by the Dow, but if over a long period we can average ten percentage points per year better than it, I will feel the results have been satisfactory.

基于我运营方法中概述的原因，相对于道琼斯指数，我们表现最佳的年份很可能出现在市场下跌或平稳时期。因此，我们所追求的优势幅度可能会有很大差异。必然会有一些年份，我们的表现不如道琼斯指数，但如果从长期来看，我们每年平均能比它高出 10 个百分点，我就会认为结果是令人满意的。

Specifically, if the market should be down 35% or 40% in a year (and I feel this has a high probability of occurring one year in the next ten --no one knows which one), we should be down only 15% or 20%. If it is more or less unchanged during the year, we would hope to be up about ten percentage points. If it is up 20% or more, we would struggle to be up as much. It is certainly doubtful we could match a 20% or 25% advance from the December 31, 1962 level. The consequence of performance such as this over a period of years would mean that if the Dow produces a 5% per year overall gain compounded, I would hope our results might be 15% per year.

具体来说，如果某一年市场下跌 35% 或 40%（我觉得在未来十年里，很有可能会有这样一年 —— 没人知道是哪一年），我们的跌幅应该只有 15% 或 20%。如果当年市场基本持平，我们希望能上涨约 10 个百分点。如果市场上涨 20% 或更多，我们会努力跟上涨幅。从 1962 年 12 月 31 日的水平来看，我们能否实现 20% 或 25% 的涨幅还很难说。如果多年来都保持这样的表现，那就意味着，如果道琼斯指数每年实现 5% 的复合总涨幅，我希望我们的业绩能达到每年 15%。

The above expectations may sound somewhat rash, and there is no question but that they may appear very much so when viewed from the vantage point of 1965 or 1970. Variations in any given year from the behavior described above would be wide, even if the long-term expectation was correct. Certainly, you have to recognize the possibility of substantial personal bias in such hopes.

上述预期听起来可能有些草率，从 1965 年或 1970 年的角度来看，这些预期无疑会显得非常草率。即使长期预期是正确的，在任何一年，实际表现与上述预期的差异也可能很大。当然，你必须认识到，这些预期可能存在个人主观因素。

_Miscellaneous_

_其他事项_

This year marked the transition from the office off the bedroom to one a bit (quite a bit) more conventional. Surprising as it may seem, the return to a time clock life has not been unpleasant. As a matter of fact, I enjoy not keeping track of everything on the backs of envelopes.

今年，我完成了办公室的搬迁，从卧室旁边的小空间搬到了一个更常规（大得多）的办公室。令人惊讶的是，回归朝九晚五的工作节奏并不让人讨厌。事实上，我很享受不再在信封背面记录各种事项的生活。

We are starting off this year with net assets of $9,405,400.00. At the start of 1962, Susie and I had three “nonmarketable security” investments of other than nominal size, and two of these have been sold. The third will be continued indefinitely. From the proceeds of the two sales, we have added to our partnership interest so that we now have an interest of $1,377,400.00. Also, my three children, mother, father, two sisters, two brothers-in-law, father-in-law, three aunts, four cousins, five nieces and nephews have interests directly or indirectly totaling $893,600.00.

从审计师的证明中你会看到，他们在当年进行了一次突击检查，而且这将成为他们的常规工作。皮特・马威克・米切尔会计师事务所（Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co.）在审计工作中再次表现出色，满足了我们苛刻的时间要求。

Susie was in charge of equipping the office which means we did not follow my “orange crate" approach to interior decorating. We have an ample supply of Pepsi on hand and look forward to partners dropping in.

苏茜负责办公室的装修布置，这意味着我们没有采用我那 “用橘子箱当家具” 的室内装饰风格。我们备有充足的百事可乐，期待合伙人来访。

Enclosed you will find Schedule “A” to your partnership agreement. You will be receiving your audit and tax figures very soon, and if you have questions on any of this be sure to let me hear from you.
